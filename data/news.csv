New Delhi: IndiGo and SpiceJet on Sunday shifted partial operations to Terminal 2 (T2) of the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the national capital, with both the airline reporting an on time departure of the flights and smooth operations.

IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, said 18 flights took off from the terminal in less than 12 hours and it worked in tandem with the Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), the airport operator, to ensure a seamless transition. Passengers were made aware of the move, it added.

“On day one, all our departures left either on time or before time without any No Shows. This has been possible because of the tremendous efforts that have been put in by my hundreds of team members in a very short period of time,” IndiGo president and whole-time director Aditya Ghosh said in a statement.

Similarly, a SpiceJet spokesperson said: “The operations and departure of its flights went smoothly without any delays and glitches and there was excellent and coordinated team work by SpiceJet ground staff. Eight flights have departed from T2 till now.”

Operations at the terminal kicked off 12am onwards on Sunday. IndiGo will be operating over 100 flights to T2 while SpiceJet will have 22 flights operating out of T2. The walking time between T2 and T3 will be five minutes.

After much dilly-dallying and court battles, IndiGo had on 15 March announced to relocate a chunk of its operations to the revamped T2 from 25 March. A day earlier, budget carrier SpiceJet too had announced to move 22 of its flights to seven destinations from T2. GoAir had moved its entire operations to T2 in October last year.

Complying with the recent order of the Supreme Court, both IndiGo and SpiceJet had submitted lists of sectors to GMR-led DIAL for shifting to T2 and DIAL had given its consent to the proposal. In its statement today, IndiGo said it kept its passengers informed well in advance via messages, emails and calls about the shifting of their flights to T2.

Besides, an extensive media campaign was launched for dissemination of the information. Extensive road signages have been put up by IndiGo over and above those provided by the airport operator. Free shuttle services at 10 minutes interval will also be made available between T1 and T2, DIAL said in a separate statement.

IndiGo staff were stationed in bright yellow T-shirts both at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 of the airport to address and assist passengers in need. Senior leaders of the airline were also present throughout the night to oversee operations.

T2, spread over 36,000 square meter, has been provided with 74 check-in counters, 18 self-check-in kiosks, 12 X-ray machines and six baggage reclaim belts. It has 16 boarding gates, including aero-bridges.","IndiGo, SpiceJet report smooth transition to T2 of Delhi airport","['operating', 'transition', 'spicejet', 'dial', 'terminal', 'operations', 'passengers', 'delhi', 'smooth', 't2', 'airport', 'flights', 'report', 'indigo']","IndiGo will be operating over 100 flights to T2 while SpiceJet will have 22 flights operating out of T2.

Mysuru: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of being “afraid” to face the no-confidence motion moved against it.

“In parliament, a no-confidence motion against the Modi government has been moved. For the past 10 days it has been stalled because the government is afraid,” Gandhi said at a public rally in Mysuru.

The second half of the budget session of Parliament has been a complete washout since commencement with protests from the Congress, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the YSR Congress Party on various issues stalling the proceedings.

The Congress has given a notice to move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government, becoming the third party to do so after YSRCP and TDP. With the Lok Sabha not being in order, the no-confidence motion of YSRCP and TDP have not been taken up so far. The government has stated that it was willing for a discussion on the no-confidence motion.

In his speeches almost devoted entirely to attack Modi, Gandhi targeted the government on the PNB fraud, foreign policy and Jammu and Kashmir situation. “Wherever you see around India, you would find China. You would find China in Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Maldives... Once they were India’s friends, they are now China’s friends”, he said. “On Bhutan’s land, China builds a road and a helipad and keeps a guard and the 56-inch person does not speak a word,” he said, taking a jibe at the prime minister.

On Jammu and Kashmir, Gandhi said there were terror attacks in the state but when the Congress-led UPA government came to power, it broke the spine of terrorists. Neither civilians nor soldiers were being killed, he claimed. “But for the sake of power, Modi backed the PDP to form government and ignited fire in Jammu and Kashmir... there is violence in Jammu and Kashmir and Modiji is not speaking a word”, Rahul said.

On the upcoming Karnataka elections, Gandhi said he was confident of his party winning not only the state but also the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“The Congress needs to fight harder at every single booth and defeat the BJP.I am confident that we will win Karnataka in 2018 and in the general elections in 2019,” he said. The Congress would give a tough fight to the BJP in each and every booth and give them a crushing defeat, he added.

According to Gandhi, Modi does not care for farmers’ welfare as he refused to waive off their loans. Gandhi said the fight was between two ideologies of creating conflicts and uniting the nation. “This fight is between ideologies. On one hand, we have BJP-RSS who have an ideology that creates conflict between religions and on the other hand there is the Congress whose ideology unites this nation,” he said.

At a rally in K.R. Pete, Gandhi continued his attack on the Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, and asked former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda’s party to come clean on its support to the BJP.

“JDS, they have to make it clear whether they are the BJP’s B-team or not,” Gandhi said at the meeting in the Vokkaliga belt of the old Mysuru region, considered a JDS stronghold. “They (JDS) have to make it clear whether they are supporting the BJP, if yes, why? The JDS stands for ‘Janata Dal Sangh Parivar’,” he added.

Terming employment generation the “biggest problem” in India, Gandhi attacked the BJP-led central government for “not” fulfilling the promises it had made to the people such as job creation and addressing the issue of farmer distress.

Praising the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka, the Congress president said it had worked for the poor, downtrodden and backward communities. Gandhi even credited the chief minister for running a “clean government”.

Raising the Nirav Modi issue and alleging that the diamantaire had run away with Rs22,000 crore, the Congress president questioned Modi’s silence on the matter. “What kind of chowkidaari (watchman’s job) is Narendra Modi doing,” he asked.

The Congress president is on his fourth round of campaigning for Karnataka elections. He had earlier toured the northern, coastal and Malnad regions. The Karnataka elections are likely to be held in April-May.","Modi govt ‘afraid’ of no-confidence motion, says Rahul Gandhi","['govt', 'congress', 'noconfidence', 'party', 'afraid', 'rahul', 'karnataka', 'elections', 'modi', 'president', 'kashmir', 'gandhi', 'motion']","Photo: PTIMysuru: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of being “afraid” to face the no-confidence motion moved against it.

2,Air India pilots still waiting for govt nod for common pay structure,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/soQX5EkR3rq33cwIw2fOnL/Air-India-pilots-still-waiting-for-govt-nod-for-common-pay-s.html,"The Indian Pilots Guild had given its consent to the common pay structure in 2017, after which the proposal was sent to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its approval, which is still ‘awaited’","Air India pilots deboarding from an aircraft in New Delhi.

Mumbai:As many as 500 Air India pilots are awaiting government’s nod for the common pay structure recommended by the Dharmadhikari committee in 2012, nearly six months after the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) consented to it.

According to people familiar with the development, the IPG gave consent to the common pay structure in October 2017, following which the proposal was sent to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its approval, which is still “awaited”.

The Dharmadhikari panel had submitted its report to the government way back in January 2012, calling for common pay and allowances as per the norms for other public sector enterprises.

The IPG represents the Boeing wide-body fleet at the flag carrier. It agreed to accept the common pay structure for pilots in line with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines.

Under the common pay structure, flying allowance will be paid only in rupees and not in dollars, the IPG had said. Besides, pilots’ flying allowance hours will be reduced to 70 hours per month from 80 earlier.

However, they will be entitled to higher over-time fees. When contacted, an Air India spokesperson declined to comment, saying it is an internal policy issue. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), which represents the Airbus fleet pilots at the state-owned carrier, has long ago accepted the recommendations.

Meanwhile, Air India has decided to promote some 100 pilots to the executive rank as part of the level-mapping exercise, sources said.

“At the time of merger, a section of Air India narrow-body (erstwhile Indian Airlines) pilots got promoted. On the other hand, a section of wide-body (Air India) pilots had not got any promotion since 2007, resulting in anomalies,” they said.

The promotion of 100-odd pilots is aimed at removing such discrepancies, sources said. Once the agreement is in place, the pilots in Air India will have a uniform salary structure for both the Airbus and Boeing fleets, as per the sources.

Following the decision to merge the two airlines in 2007, various processes were to be integrated within 18-24 months, including HR. To arrive at common structure, the ministry constituted a committee of external experts under Justice Dharmadhikari.

The panel submitted its report in January 2012, which was further examined by a three-member inter-ministerial committee to suggest a time frame for implementation.

The inter-ministerial panel submitted its report in May 2012, and subsequently an implementation-cum-anomaly rectification committee was set up to implement the recommendations of the panel.",Air India pilots still waiting for govt nod for common pay structure,"['hours', 'govt', 'structure', 'flying', 'panel', 'india', 'pay', 'common', 'ipg', 'waiting', 'nod', 'air', 'pilots']","Air India pilots deboarding from an aircraft in New Delhi.

New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi after allegations surfaced that data from his NaMo app was being shared without users’ consent, a charge the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trashed.

Gandhi also accused the media of “burying” the NaMo app data leak story.

Gandhi’s attack on the prime minister was based on a media report in which a French vigilante hacker has purportedly alleged that data was stolen from the NaMo app without consent of the users.

“Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India’s Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official app, I give all your data to my friends in American companies,” Gandhi said on Twitter.

Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies.



Ps. Thanks mainstream media, you're doing a great job of burying this critical story, as always.https://t.co/IZYzkuH1ZH — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) March 25, 2018

In the tweet, he also attached a news story titled, Data theft allegations reaches PM Modi’s doorstep, French vigilante hacker’s stunning revelation.

The BJP reacted on Twitter saying, it did not expect “any better” from the Congress chief. It also said the data is used only for analytics using a third-party service, similar to Google Analytics.

People aware of the development said the NaMo app does not ask for blanket permissions when it is launched. They said the app is unique in nature, which unlike most apps, gives access to users in “guest mode” without even any permission or data. The permissions required are all “contextual and cause-specific”, the people pointed out.

“We also take this opportunity to encourage Rahul Gandhi to download NaMo App to keep himself appraised of the good things happening in India,” the BJP4India said in a tweet. It put out several tweets on the matter.

“Contrary to Rahul’s lies, fact is that data is being used for only analytics using third-party service, similar to Google Analytics. Analytics on the user data is done for offering users the most contextual content,” the BJP added.

“Rahul Gandhi is no match for Narendra Modi. But seeing his fright about the Namo App, is very amusing. When his bots tried to trend #DeleteNamoApp day before yesterday, the popularity and downloads of Namo App only increased,” it said.

In his tweet, Gandhi also attacked the media. “Ps. Thanks mainstream media, you’re doing a great job of burying this critical story, as always,” Gandhi tweeted.

The Congress and the BJP have indulged in a slinging match over data theft and the use of services of Cambridge Analytica, accused of harvesting data from Facebook.","Rahul Gandhi alleges data-sharing by NaMo app, BJP hits back","['alleges', 'data', 'media', 'app', 'rahul', 'namo', 'narendra', 'prime', 'minister', 'hits', 'gandhi', 'datasharing', 'bjp']","Rahul Gandhi also accused the media of ‘burying’ the NaMo app data leak story.

New Delhi: E-commerce platform ShopClues on Sunday said its revenues have grown by 60% this fiscal, while losses have been trimmed by almost 40% compared to the previous year as it focusses on growing business from categories like fashion and strengthening position in tier III cities and beyond.

The Gurgaon-based company, which competes with the likes of Flipkart and Amazon, is also confident of hitting profits in the next 12-18 months. Speaking to PTI, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Sanjay Sethi said the 2017 was spent ensuring that the company has the “right revenue margins” without any discounting or heavy spending on warehousing adding to its costs.

“2018 will be about continuing the growth. We became unit economic positive across all categories last year and we are looking at hitting profits in the coming fiscal,” he said. Sethi declined to comment on topline and bottomline numbers as these numbers are still being audited, Sethi said revenues have grown about 60%, while losses have come down by about 40%.

According to documents filed by the company with the corporate affairs ministry, ShopClues’ revenue from operations was at Rs180.3 crore in 2016-17, against Rs161.4 crore in the preceding fiscal. Its losses were also lower at Rs332.65 crore for the year ended March 2017 compared to a loss of Rs383.05 crore in 2015-16.

“We are like the ‘bazaar’. Our customers are cost-conscious. They are definitely ambitious and want the big brands but a significant part of their purchases is still done through places like local markets,” Sethi explained.

He added that about 80 % of the company’s orders come from tier III cities and beyond from places like Haflong, Palai, Chatrapur etc and that these customers are also buying more frequently—20% more as compared to those in metros.

Asked about competition against heavyweights like Flipkart and Amazon, ShopClues co-founder and chief business officer Radhika Ghai said there is enough room in the market for multiple players to grow. “Everyone thought shopping malls will kill big markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi. But that hasn’t happened. People throng both of these locations and are buying. Same is the case with us and our competitors,” she said.

Ghai added that the company has till date raised about $200 million and on track to hit profits, which shows that its “business model is working well”. She pointed that the e-commerce market in India is underpenetrated at about 2% of the multi-billion dollar retail industry in India and there is room for all the players to grow their business.","ShopClues sees 60% revenue growth, eyes profits in 12-18 months","['1218', 'eyes', 'company', 'business', 'profits', 'shopclues', '60', 'grown', 'fiscal', 'sees', 'revenue', 'crore', 'months', 'losses', 'sethi', 'revenues', 'growth']","A file photo of ShopClues CEO Sanjay Sethi who says revenues have grown by about 60% while losses have come down by about 40%.

New Delhi: Former NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya has made a strong case for privatisation of public sector banks with the exception of State Bank of India, saying that political parties serious of forming government in 2019 should include the proposal in their manifesto.

Panagariya, who is currently a professor of economics at Columbia University, said predominance of scandals and non-performing assets in PSU banks are important reasons for bank privatisation.

“I firmly believe that privatisation of all public sector banks, except perhaps the State Bank of India, should be on the election manifestos of all parties who wish to present themselves as serious candidates to form the government in 2019,” Panagariya said when asked about the recent banking frauds, including the one at Punjab National Bank (PNB).

The economist further argued that efficiency and productivity demand that the government relinquish its control of those PSU banks whose market valuation has dwindled despite the fact that they hold the bulk of the deposits.

Panagariya noted that it is disingenuous to argue, as many advocates of PSU banks do, that achieving social goals of lending requires two dozen banks in the public sector.

“The fact of the matter is that private sector banks have often performed better than public sector banks in delivering on their priority-sector-lending obligations,” he pointed out.

Asked to comment on recent trade tensions, with US President Donald Trump targeting India, Panagariya said that he would not hesitate to liberalize India’s trade further rather than risk the US closing its markets to Indian goods.

On Nobel laureate Paul Krugman’s recent comment that India story could end with mass unemployment, the former NITI Aayog vice chairman admitted that Krugman is surely right to point to the importance of manufacturing in the economic transformation of a developing country.

“I think manufacturing growth is essential for creating productive and well-paid jobs rather than escape mass unemployment,” he said, adding that the economy is surely creating jobs. “The problem we face is that it is creating very few jobs that fully exploit the potential of our workers,” Panagariya said.

Talking about overall Indian economy, he said that India remains stable in macroeconomic terms. “The GDP growth rate has been on the rising trend during the latest two quarters for which we have data—it rose from 5.7% during the first quarter of 2017-18 to 6.5% in the second quarter and 7.2% in the third quarter. I expect the upward trend to continue,” Panagariya said.

On farmer protests across India, the economist said he always favoured cash transfers to rural BPL (below poverty line) households in times of crop failures via Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. “In the medium run, the government strategy of raising farmer incomes through marketing reforms and increased farm productivity are right on target,” Panagariya said.

New Delhi:The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is all set to make face authentication available alongside iris or fingerprint scan as means of verifying Aadhaar users from 1 July, 2018.

The UIDAI, which is in-charge of the 12-digit identifier Aadhaar, in January had announced that it will introduce face authentication feature to help those who run into problems in biometric authentication due to old age, hardwork or worn-out fingerprints.

It had said that face authentication will be allowed only in fusion mode meaning it would be permitted along with either fingerprint or iris or OTP to verify the details of Aadhaar holders.

In a presentation to the Supreme Court last week where he emphasised the robustness of the Aadhaar encryption system saying breaking it may take “more than the age of the universe for the fastest computer on earth”, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey also informed that the proposed face authentication feature will be introduced by 1 July.

“Face authentication shall be available in fusion mode along with one more authentication factor like fingerprint/iris/OTP from 1 July, 2018,” he had said in the power point presentation titled ‘1 billion +’.

Aadhaar is being used for identity authentication across banks, telecom companies, public distribution system, income tax amongst others and the extent of its usage can well be gauged from the fact that an average of 4 crore authentications are being done on a daily basis.

Even in his presentation, the UIDAI CEO has pointed out that 1,696.38 crore Aadhaar authentications and 464.85 crore eKYC transactions have been performed so far.

Seeking to allay concerns over government’s ambitious Aadhaar scheme, Pandey had said that UIDAI does not collect purpose, location or details of transaction.

7,ONGC may buy out GAIL in OPaL,https://www.livemint.com/Money/mPXslhiRPbKSjhbhtnEecN/ONGC-may-buy-out-GAIL-in-OPaL.html,GAIL had picked up 19% stake in OPaL in Gujarat’s Dahej but the project faced major cost overruns which forced it to restrict its equity contribution to Rs996.28 crore,"ONGC’s petrochemical complex in Dahej. People privy of the developement said GAIL is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in the project at Rs996.28 crore.

New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.

GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.

But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs996.28 crore.

This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17%, then to 15.5% and now about 9%, sources privy to the development said.

“It doesn’t make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,” they said.

The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs30,000 crore.

After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19% stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date.

People privy of the development said when project cost was revised to Rs19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company’s board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs1,000 crore.

Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But when the project cost went up further to Rs21,396 crore, the promoter’s equity contribution increased from Rs5,860.5 crore to Rs6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio.

GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved—Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5% stake. Now that the project cost almost touched Rs30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9% stake.

Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5% stake, did not make more equity contributions.

Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s National Agricultural Development Co., part owned by the sovereign wealth fund, will acquire Danone SA’s venture in the country, creating one of the kingdom’s largest dairy producers.

Nadec, as the company is known, will fund the acquisition of privately held Al Safi Danone through a capital increase of 536 million riyals ($143 million), it said in a statement to the Saudi stock market Sunday. Once the deal is completed, existing Nadec shareholders will own 61.25% of the company, and Al Safi shareholders will hold 38.75%.

“The transaction will allow both companies to better serve customers and realize benefits not available on a standalone basis,” Abdulaziz Al Babtain, managing director of Nadec, said in the statement. “It will create a platform for future growth and, importantly, drive significant value creation for shareholders.”

Nadec shares rose as much as 8.4% to 40.70 riyals ($10.86). They closed at 39.38 riyals ($10.51), the highest since September 2014.

Merger and acquisition activity in Saudi Arabia is picking up as slower economic growth encourages companies to combine to save costs, while new takeover rules make it easier to complete deals.

Sahara Petrochemical and Saudi International Petrochemical Co. said they were evaluating a merger earlier this month. HSBC Holdings Plc-backed Saudi British Bank and Alawwal Bank, in which Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc owns a 40% stake, are in talks to merge, as are hospital operators Al Hammadi Co. for Development & Investment and National Medical Care Co.

London:Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page ads in almost all of Britain’s national newspapers today to apologise for a huge data privacy scandal.

“We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t we don’t deserve it,” the back page ads state. Zuckerberg explained there was a quiz developed by a university researcher “that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014”.

“This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” he said.

The statement reflects public statements Zuckerberg made last week after the row prompted investigations in Europe and the United States, and sent Facebook’s share price plunging. Zuckerberg repeated that Facebook had changed the rules so no such data breach could happen again.

“We’re also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others,” he wrote. “And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.”

There was no mention of the British firm accused of using the data, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.

It too has blamed the University of Cambridge researcher, Alexsandr Kogan, for any potential breach of data rules.

New Delhi: State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will invest about Rs4,300 crore to expand network in 2018-19, and another Rs5,000-6,000 crore is likely to be utilised for government telecom projects, according to a top official.

12,Trump tightens screws on Putin but says he wants to get along,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/AkvcsD4G8c0upeYG6sgk8I/Trump-tightens-screws-on-Putin-but-says-he-wants-to-get-alon.html,The decision to expel Russian diplomats by the Trump administration will align Washington with European allies who feel threatened by Russia,"While US policy toward Russia has gradually grown more strident in recent months, President Donald Trump’s critics say he has been slow to respond to Moscow’s provocations. Photo: AFP

Washington: President Donald Trump is poised to take his most aggressive actions yet against Russia on Monday, when he’s likely to announce the expulsion of dozens of diplomats in response to the nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy living in the UK.

The move, all but certain to provoke retaliation by President Vladimir Putin’s government, comes as Trump has tried to maintain at least the semblance of a constructive relationship with the Russian leader.

But the expulsions will align Trump with European allies who feel threatened by Russia and have had a turbulent relationship with the US president, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Several European countries are expected to announce their own expulsions of Russian diplomats in concert with the US.

While US policy toward Russia has gradually grown more strident in recent months, the president’s critics say he has been slow to respond to Putin’s provocations. Some have drawn a connection to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government as well as Trump’s past business relationships with Russian figures.

‘Good Thing’

Trump has denied any campaign collusion and as recently as Wednesday advocated for an amicable relationship with Russia. “Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he said on Twitter.

The US considers the diplomats it plans to expel to be spies, carrying out intelligence activities under cover as embassy staff, one person familiar with the matter said. Trump’s action would follow a similar move by May, who ordered 23 Russians that she said were spies to leave Britain over the attack on the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter.

“The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia’s outrageous action,” White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement on Saturday. “The president is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities.”

But Putin has proven expert at exploiting even the slightest divisions among Western allies, and Trump is concerned that European capitals may not follow through on promises to tighten the screws on the Kremlin. The president regards Germany, in particular, as wobbly because of its dependence on Russian fuel supplies.

NSC Recommendations

Trump’s National Security Council reached recommendations for a US response to the UK attack at a meeting on Wednesday and presented the proposals to him on Friday. Trump discussed the issue that day with US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, FBI director Chris Wray, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, defense secretary James Mattis, director of national intelligence Dan Coats, outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster and others, two people familiar with the talks said.

All of the people who discussed the president’s deliberations asked not to be identified. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.

A division within the White House over how to confront Putin flared this week after Trump called the Russian president on Tuesday and congratulated him for winning an election regarded in the West as largely fraudulent. The praise drew criticism from Congress and ran contrary to written talking points for the call that advised Trump not to congratulate the Russian leader, a person familiar with the matter said. Trump didn’t read the guidance.

Trump meanwhile has reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations who has promoted military action against Iraq, Iran and North Korea. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.

Congress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive US measures imposed after Russia’s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington’s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump’s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin’s provocations.

Personal Relationship

The president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won’t publicly attack him, and doesn’t see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said Thursday. But Russia’s brazen aggression is compelling a US response.

The attack against Skripal employed a nerve agent called “Novichok” manufactured by the Soviet Union, according to the UK government. May earlier this month condemned Russia for the apparent assassination attempt, which critically injured the former Russian spy and his daughter. A British police officer was also hospitalized.

Regardless of Trump’s rhetoric, his administration regards the Kremlin as a threat.

A national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the US. Earlier this month, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet “troll farm” and its alleged owner—a close Putin ally—whom Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 election.

13,"Listening, a vital managerial skill",https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/iYgY19AA7n3Wszw1KG5nrO/Listening-a-vital-managerial-skill.html,"The deepest listening often occurs in total silence, and with an open mind","Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint

We don’t listen well enough. Many managers like me speak well, read well, make grand presentations, try hard to lead from the front, and we also attempt a host of other good official deeds, for which we deserve due commendation. But sadly, we are poor listeners. Often, we may hear, but we don’t listen.

This is despite the fact that for most professions, over 75% of the work we do is based on listening to others. Imagine a marketer not listening to his customers, or an HR professional not listening to young managers, or a leader not listening to her team members. So, most people will agree that listening is a powerful and essential managerial skill. Unfortunately, it is not a skill that receives adequate focus, either in business schools or in organizations. Here are some simple suggestions on how we can listen better.

Keep quiet

We love hearing the sound of our own voice, so we don’t keep shut often enough. But if you have to listen carefully to someone else, you have to shut up. The deepest listening often occurs in total silence, where what you are hearing can be absorbed beautifully into your mind, without having to contend with the clutter of extraneous noise. I find that when I am tempted to speak out of turn, which is quite often, putting my finger on my lips is a good way to shut up. My primary-school teacher taught me that, many years ago.

Open your mind

To listen, you need an open mind. Often, when we hear something that goes against the grain of our existing belief, we tend not to listen any more, simply because we don’t wish to hear that we are wrong. Defences build up immediately in our mind, and then we are done. On the other hand, most new ideas emerge from something that is not aligned to existing knowledge. So the best way to listen is to keep your ears wide open for negative evidence—evidence that says you are wrong—and pay particular attention to why the speaker thinks that way. Don’t begin the process of evaluation until you have heard him/her out fully. An open mind does not guarantee you true enlightenment, but it certainly helps.

Put away your phone

Opening your mind during a meeting does not help if you have simultaneously also opened your mobile phone or laptop. When you are listening to your colleague speak, put away your digital devices, and watch the positive energy flow. WhatsApp and emails are the best way to plug your ears, and Facebook is not far behind. On the other hand, two or more people, face to face, discussing a topic without any digital distraction threatening to raise its head, makes for the best listening platform. A colleague of mine always places his bright red mobile phone right at the other corner of the room before he sits at any important meeting. He says it helps to keep temptation far away.

Forget the food

Our listening ability is, unfortunately, inversely correlated with our hunger and our abiding interest in food. As mealtime approaches, a few participants begin actively daydreaming about what could be on the menu for lunch or dinner, which is a recipe for delicious distraction from the subject at hand. But then we need to reckon with pangs of hunger, which are totally real, and yet find ways of remaining unmoved. I find that carrying a small hard boiled sweet in my pocket is a very helpful device. When hunger strikes, I pop the sweet into my mouth, roll it around my tongue, which helps me to continue listening intently, until the meal break.

Wait, then ask

Once you have listened well, and there is a natural pause in the speaker’s flow of conversation, it is a good idea then to ask questions that help bring clarity to your own thinking. Don’t hesitate to do this, because productive listening requires clarity. Sometimes, if you are listening to a colleague who has come to speak to you, you could even ask him to clarify exactly what he means, or really needs from you—this reassures both of you that you are thinking in the same direction. But unless there is some compelling urgency, such as an inter-galactic corporate shutdown within the next 5 minutes, don’t interrupt a speaker in the midst of her flow; that will spoil your own voyage of listening and also irritate everyone else.

Listen with all senses

If you need to listen really well, then non-verbal cues are as important as what is said. The best listeners carefully observe the speaker’s face and body language to understand what is really meant, including the subtext. This is quite an art, because you must know what to observe and it is never good to be caught staring. How something is said, and what is left unsaid, is equally important to pick out. Once, I heard and saw one of my team members become totally and instantly energized while speaking about a certain specific topic in consumer behaviour, and I knew instantly where his heart and mind lay. It helped me assign him to exactly the right project when the opportunity came up, and he is now a star performer there.

Leave useless meetings

There is no documented research yet on the number of totally useless meetings that each of us attends and listens in to. But the results of such a study would be quite revealing, I am sure. Once we are in a meeting or conversation, we generally tend to stay there and listen listlessly, until the session has concluded—even if we discover the subject to be a bore or quite irrelevant to our needs. Perhaps we do this as a matter of courtesy, or maybe because our boss is around, or even out of sheer inertia. Nothing could be more damaging. It is always preferable to stop listening and politely excuse yourself, which is acceptable in many such sessions, though not always.

San Francisco/Singapore:Uber Technologies Inc. has reached an agreement to sell its Southeast Asian ride-hailing business to rival Grab and could announce the deal as early as Monday morning in Singapore, people familiar with the matter said.

The agreement—which includes all of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia as well as Uber Eats in the region—gives Uber a stake of between 25% and 30% in the new combined business, the people said, asking not to be identified ahead of an official announcement.

The deal, which Bloomberg outlined earlier this month, marks Uber’s operational exit from yet another major market and hands a victory to Grab as it battles local competitor Go-Jek.

SoftBank Group Corp., a major backer of Grab’s and Uber’s as well as China’s Didi Chuxing, has pushed consolidation to improve the profitability of a global ride-hailing business that bleeds billions of dollars a year. New entrants and the strength of second-place regional players such as Lyft Inc. in the U.S. has complicated those efforts.

Representatives for Grab and Uber declined to comment.

The deal represents another major retreat from international markets for Uber. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive officer, sold Uber’s business in China in 2016 in return for a 17.5% stake in Chinese ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing. Then Uber agreed to sell its Russian business to Yandex—just before after Dara Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive.

Khosrowshahi has been pushing to clean up the company’s financials in preparations for an initial public offering next year. Pulling out of markets like Southeast Asia would boost profits at a company that has burned through $10.7 billion since its founding nine years ago. Khosrowshahi signaled during a trip through Asia last month that he is committed to key markets such as Japan and India.

New Delhi:The telecom industry, which has been witnessing job losses due to consolidation, is expected to create over 10 million employment opportunities in the next five years, as per the skill development body for the sector.

“There are 4 million people employed in the telecom sector and by the end of five years, 14.3 million people will be employed in telecom as well as telecom manufacturing,” Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC) CEO S.P. Kochhar told PTI in an interview.

According to a CIEL HR report, since last year the telecom sector has already lost around 40,000 jobs and the trend is likely to continue for the next six-nine months, with the total figure expected to reach 80,000-90,000.

Kochhar said TSSC, under the National Skill Development Corporation, expects major demand for employment to come from emerging technologies like machine-to-machine communications, followed by telecom manufacturing, infrastructure and services companies.

“We are increasingly seeing manufacturing line coming to India. That gives us a lot of hope in the telecom sector as far as skilling is concerned. There we have huge amount of potential and the projections that are made by telecom manufacturing industry is that 14.2 lakh people will be employed in this sector,” Kochhar said.

He said TSSC is going to build training modules based on national occupational standards which will be prepared in conjunction with the industry and is approved by the government.

Besides, the telecom sector skill body has proposed to the government to change the approach of looking for employment after training to training based on job demand that will come from industry.

Kocchar said players in the telecom sector fear attrition if the workforce is upskilled. “We are trying to allay those fears (upskilling leading to attrition ) and say it will not happen and also telling the industry the benefits of taking skilled manpower,” he said.

Kocchar said TSSC is willing to invest to create a centre of excellence where people can be trained around products in the sector.

“The tower companies are showing interest in this type of a venture. We will invest for creating the training centre and they would give us equipments out of CSR (corporate social responsibility), where we will train all tower technicians and then they are free to employ them. This is the type of ecosystem we are creating in the next one year,” Kocchar added.","Telecom sector to create 10 million jobs in next five years, says skilling council","['jobs', 'create', 'training', 'tssc', 'skilling', 'industry', 'employment', 'kochhar', 'million', 'manufacturing', 'skill', 'council', 'telecom', 'sector']","Kochhar expects major demand for employment to come from emerging technologies like machine-to-machine communications, followed by telecom manufacturing, infrastructure and services companies.

New Delhi: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering to come out with new norms on share buyback programme, under which maximum limit for share repurchase will be 25% of the company’s paid up capital and other reserves.

The company may buyback its shares and other securities from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis through the tender offer; open market via—book building process and stock exchange—and odd-lot holders, senior officials said.

This will be applicable provided that no offer of buyback for 15% of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company will be made from the open markets. The proposal will be discussed at the board meeting of Sebi this week, they added.

The regulator plans to come out with a consultation paper on the share and other securities buyback programme and seek public comments on the same. The final regulations will be put in place after taking views of all the stakeholders. Under the proposal, the maximum limit of any buyback would be 25% or less of the aggregate of paid up capital and free reserves of the company.

Besides, the ratio of the aggregate secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buyback may not be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves. According to the proposal, the company would not buyback its shares to delist its scrips, besides, the firm would not repurchase its scrips through negotiated deals, whether on or off the stock exchange through spot transactions or through any private arrangement.

“A company shall not make any offer of buyback within a period of one year reckoned from the date of closure of the preceding offer of buyback,” as per the proposal. The company may not be allowed to purchase its own shares through any subsidiary company and any investment company. Further, the firm would not directly or indirectly purchase its own shares if a default is made by it.

However, such buyback would not be prohibited if the default is remedied and period of three years has lapsed after such default ceased to subsist. If a company completes buyback of its shares, it will not make a further issue of the same kind of scrips including allotment of new shares within six months except by way of bonus issue or in the discharge of subsisting obligations such as warrants, stock option schemes and conversion of preference shares or debentures into equity shares.

The companies will have to complete their buyback offers within a period of one year of passing a special resolution by the general meeting or the special resolution passed by the board of directors.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday focussed on agriculture and healthcare in his Mann Ki Baat radio address—issues that have taken centre stage in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“An extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop,” Modi said, adding programmes to upgrade the infrastructure of 22,000 rural markets and integrating them with the electronic national agricultural market, or eNAM, will help local farmers connect to a global market.

“A system is being set up wherein farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect,” Modi said. He reminded farmers of last month’s budget provision fixing minimum support prices (MSPs) at a level which is at least 50% more than cost of production “to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce”.

Noting that the coming months when planting of rain-fed summer crops will begin is crucial for farmers, Modi advised them to adopt new technologies and practices learnt from the state broadcaster’s 24-hour farm channel DD Kisan. “Today, the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields. This has provided a big boost to our agro-producers,” Modi said.

The prime minister has addressed farmers twice over the past month, first at a conference on doubling farmer incomes last month, and again at the annual Krishi Unnati Mela organized by the agriculture ministry in March. The emphasis on farm sector follows mounting protests by farmers since June last year in backdrop of a collapse in wholesale crop prices amid record harvests.

“The prime minister promised the government will ensure that farmers benefit from MSP announcements but the situation on ground is entirely different,” said Avik Saha, convener of Jai Kisan Andolan, a farmer’s organization. “In an ongoing public audit in five states, we found that farmers incurred a loss of Rs14,474 crore while selling their winter harvest of pulses and oilseeds at prices lower than support prices.”

In his Mann Ki Baat address, the prime minister also underlined the importance of healthcare. “All you young people can come together to launch a movement of Fit India,” he said. The prime minister said Swachch Bharat (clean India) and Swasth Bharat (healthy India) are complementary to each other, adding all ministries are working together for preventive health.

“Preventive healthcare is the least costly and the easiest one as well. And, the more we become aware about preventive healthcare, the more beneficial will it be for individuals, the family and the society,” Modi said.“The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness. All of us took up the responsibility and the result is that in the last four years or so, sanitation coverage has almost doubled and risen to around 80%. Also, extensive work is going on to set up health wellness centres across the country.”

“It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.” He appealed to make the upcoming International Yoga Day on 21 June a success as previous three international yoga days. “Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways,” he said.

The prime minister said efforts were being undertaken to make healthcare accessible and affordable with more than 3,000 jan aushadhi (medicine) stores opened across the country and more than 800 medicines being made available there at affordable prices.

“The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85%. Knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50% to 70%. Under ‘Ayushman Bharat Yojana’, the government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide Rs lakh for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year,” he added.

The prime minister said a new AIIMS —All India Institutes of Medical Sciences—were being opened in various states. One new medical college will be set up for every three districts. In the existing 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68,000, he said.

Calling the task of making the country tuberculosis-free by 2025 an enormous one, Modi said, “Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness. All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.”","Mann ki Baat: Narendra Modi focuses on healthcare, agriculture reforms","['agriculture', 'yoga', 'india', 'ensure', 'mann', 'healthcare', 'farmers', 'narendra', 'baat', 'undertaken', 'modi', 'reforms', 'prime', 'minister', 'country', 'focuses', 'ki']","An extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop, said PM Narendra Modi in his Mann Ki Baat address.

File photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

New Delhi: A merger of state-run trading firms MMTC and STC is on the cards and the matter is under process, commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu has said.

“That is something which is already on cards because STC unfortunately has become a sick company. Therefore, there are some measures which are being taken already and this matter is under process,” Prabhu told PTI.

He said this while replying to a question whether the government is moving ahead on the proposal to merge Metals & Minerals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) and State Trading Corporation (STC).

STC, Project & Equipment Corporation of India (PEC) and MMTC are under the administrative control of the ministry. Earlier, the commerce ministry had commissioned a study to work out a new structure for three state-owned trading firms MMTC, STC and PEC.

While the government wholly owns PEC, it has about 90% stake in MMTC and STC. The merger of MMTC and STC would result in synergy of operations.

MMTC and STC were created in 1963 and 1956, respectively. PEC Ltd was carved out of the STC in 1971-72.

According to industry observers, these state trading companies have lost their relevance as well as business following liberalisation. MMTC used to be a canalising agency for import and export of non-ferrous metals and fertilisers. Similarly, STC was a canalising agency for imports of essential items of mass consumption such as wheat, pulses, sugar and edible oils. PEC was engaged in export and import of machinery and railway equipment.

In 2016-17, MMTC incurred a loss of about Rs30 crore. STC too reported a loss of Rs16.5 crore in the last fiscal.","STC, MMTC merger on cards, says Suresh Prabhu","['pec', 'industry', 'prabhu', 'trading', 'corporation', 'state', 'stc', 'cards', 'mmtc', 'suresh', 'merger', 'commerce']","Commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu.

New Delhi: Punjab National Bank (PNB) plans to take part in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond, a group company of jewellery designer Nirav Modi who has been accused of defrauding the state-run bank of nearly Rs13,000 crore.

The bank is exploring all options for the recovery, including participating in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond Inc, officials said.

According to officials, the bank is in the process of hiring legal experts to take the matter forward.

The legal firm would be hired soon. Various pros and cons are being examined in order to make watertight case for the recovery, officials said, adding the bank is part of unsecured creditor category.

When contacted, PNB declined to comment on the matter. Last month, Firestar Diamond, a company owned by Nirav Modi filed for bankruptcy in a New York court. The US Trustee Program oversees administration and litigation for enforcement of the bankruptcy law.

Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi in connivance with certain bank officials allegedly cheated the PNB of Rs12,968 crore through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs). A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Nirav Modi since March 2011.

Different investigating agencies, including Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate, are probing the fraud, dubbed as the biggest banking scam in the country.

Scam-hit PNB had issued as many as 1,590 LoUs to Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and their associates. The total number of LoUs issued to the companies of Nirav Modi, his relatives and the Nirav Modi Group are 1,213, and to Mehul Choksi, his relatives and the Gitanjali Group are 377. The amount of repayment made by the companies against each LoU cannot be currently ascertained as the matter is under investigation, finance ministry in a reply to Parliament had said.

PNB has apprised that payment of LoU is a contingent liability and may fall back upon the bank on due date only if the same is not paid on or before due date by the buyer.

Beijing: China pledged on Sunday to press ahead with market opening and reforms while reiterating that it will treat domestic and foreign firms equally and protect intellectual property rights.

The pledge on reform and equal treatment came from vice premier Han Zheng, at a time there are increasing prospects of a trade war with the United States.

Han, making his first speech since being named executive vice premier earlier this month, told the China Development Forum in Beijing that China needs to “open even wider to the outside world,” and would do so via its Belt and Road Initiative.

China is fully aware that economic globalisation is “irreversible,” said Han, adding that unilaterism and trade protectionism served nobody’s interests.

Also at the forum, He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said China “will deepen supply-side structural reforms and work hard to eliminate ineffective supply”.

Earlier this month, the NDRC said China, the world’s biggest steel and coal producer, would cut its annual steel capacity by around 30 million tonnes and coal capacity by about 150 million tonnes this year.

China will also promote international capacity cooperation as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which Beijing considers to be a modern-day ‘silk road’, and widen access to the Chinese market, including the financial, telecom and education sectors, He said.

Equal Protection

It will also “give equal protection to property rights of all ownership types by law,” and strengthen protection of intellectual property rights, said He, adding that China would better integrate its financial sector and real economy.

John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council told Reuters China “has been promising market-opening measures and protection of intellectual property for some time, but what the US business community is waiting for is action.”

The United States launched a complaint against China at the World Trade Organization on Friday, part of a package of trade measures announced by President Donald Trump on Thursday over China’s alleged theft of US intellectual property..

China’s ministry of commerce said on Friday it opposed US unilateralism and protectionism after Washington unveiled plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods following an intellectual property probe.

Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, who is co-chairing the forum, told the meeting the business community “has always supported the idea that open markets foster new ideas and allow entrepreneurship to thrive.”

“The strongest companies and economies are those that are open - those that thrive on diversity of people and ideas,” said Cook, who on Saturday called for “calm heads” in the brewing US-China trade dispute.

Beijing: “No change” has taken place at the Dokalam standoff area after it was resolved last year, India’s envoy Gautam Bambawale said and blamed China squarely for the face off, saying it happened because Beijing tried to alter the “status quo” which it should not have.

The 73-day long standoff ended on 28 August last year after China agreed to halt the road building activities at Dokalam in Sikkim Section.

“No, I can tell you that in Dokalam area, which we call close proximity or sometimes the face off site, the area where there was close confrontation or close proximity between Indian and Chinese military troops, there is no change taking place today,” India’s Ambassador to China Bambawale said, reacting to reports of Chinese military stepping up infrastructure build-up in the area.

The Chinese side may be putting more military barracks to put in more soldiers, but that is well behind the sensitive area, he said in an interview to Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

“Those are the things you’re free to do and we are also free to do, because you’re doing it inside your territory and we are doing it inside our territory,” Bambawale said.

Indian troops intervened to stop their Chinese counterparts building a road close to India’s narrow corridor “Chicken Neck” area connecting northeastern states. Besides China, the area is also claimed by Bhutan.

Recent reports said that Chinese military was trying to work around or outflank the Indian troops at the Dokalam area.

Bambawale also reiterated his earlier comments that China should not change the status quo along the Indian border and inform India about its plans earlier.

“In the sense that if the Chinese military is going to build a road, then they must tell us ‘we are going to build a road’. If we do not agree to it then we can reply that, ‘look, you’re changing the status quo. Please don’t do it. This is a very very sensitive area,” the envoy said.

During the Dokalam standoff, China claimed that it had informed India about its plans. About lessons to be drawn, he called for delineation of the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) which China has refused.

“The India-China boundary is un-demarcated and un-delineated, so we have to talk to each other to delineate and demarcate it, which means to draw the boundary line. “Now for the last 30 years, not a single shot had been fired between the India-China border, which shows that we have been successful at maintaining peace and tranquillity.

Even during the Dokalam incident, a very serious incident, there was no firing, we were able to maintain peace and tranquillity. I think this is a successful example of diplomacy between our two countries,” Bambawale said.

He said both countries should move further to solve the problem. “We need to move further to actually solve the problem, which is to draw the boundary line. The boundary is quite long between India and China, roughly 3,500 km. In order to maintain the peace and tranquillity, there are certain areas, certain sectors which are very sensitive, where we must not change the status quo. If anyone changes the status quo, it will lead to a situation like what happened in Dokalam.

“The Chinese military changed the status quo in the Dokalam area and therefore India reacted to it. Ours was a reaction to the change in the status quo by the Chinese military,” he said, stressing that the two countries should have high-level communication on it.

“I agree entirely that it has to be brought down to practical levels. It shows that when incidents like Dokalam happened last year, it means that we were not frank enough and candid enough with each other. So we need to increase the level of frankness,” Bambawale said.

At present both countries are having “a lot of dialogue” at the political level and also at the economic level, the Indian envoy said as he welcomed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s recent comments that Indian elephant and Chinese dragon must not fight but dance together.

Referring to various visits planned between the two countries including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June to China to take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, he said that both the countries “especially on the political level, must be very frank and open and candid with each other”.

“There are some issues and problems between India and China, if we have to solve those problems, we need to talk candidly. That’s what I mean about the candid discussion. Only through talking frankly and candidly, we will be able to solve the issues and problems and understand each other’s concerns,” Bambawale said, asserting that the boundary issue is the most important problem between India and China.

“It is a leftover from history, but today’s governments are trying to tackle it. We are giving it a high priority. But only when both sides talk to each other very frankly and candidly, we will be able to resolve this boundary issue and decide on a boundary,” the envoy said. Both the sides should address each other’s concerns, he said.

“There are two principles that India has suggested to China. One is that each side must be sensitive to the other side’s aspirations, their concerns, their priorities and so on. The second is that we must not allow differences to become disputes. For example, we might have differences of opinion on Belt and Road, but that we must not allow that difference of opinion to become a dispute,” Bambawale added.

New Delhi: Gold prices rose by Rs85 to trade at one-month high of Rs31,835 per 10 grams on Saturday on strong global cues and increased buying by local jewellers.

Silver prices also went up by Rs50 to Rs39,600 per kg, on sustained buying by industrial units and coin makers.

Ranchi: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad was on Saturday sentenced to 14 years in jail and fined Rs60 lakh by a special CBI court in the fourth fodder scam case pertaining to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs3.13 crore from the Dumka treasury in the early 1990s, a CBI counsel said in Ranchi.

CBI judge Shiv Pal Singh awarded two sentences of seven years each to the former Bihar chief minister under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Acts, he said.

New Delhi: A day after securing bail from the Delhi high court in INX Media case, Karti Chidambaram on Saturday got another relief from a Delhi court which granted him protection from arrest till 16 April in Aircel-Maxis matter arising out of the 2G spectrum cases lodged by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Special Judge O.P. Saini granted the relief to him considering that both the investigative agencies sought three weeks to file their responses on the anticipatory bail plea moved by Karti, son of former union minister P. Chidambaram.

The court, which pronounced the order in a packed courtroom, also said that Karti shall not leave the country without its permission and will appear before the investigating officer as and when directed to join the investigation.

“Since three weeks’ time is prayed for by the CBI, by submitting that during this period law shall prevail, apparently it means that as a matter of legal and judicial propriety, the applicant (Karti) shall not be arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) during the pendency of the instant application. This is in consonance with the provisions of section 41A of the CrPC.

“Accordingly, it is directed that in case presence of the applicant is required by the IO during three weeks’ time prayed for by the senior PP for the CBI, he shall appear before the IO as and when directed and shall join the investigation,” the judge said.

An identical order was passed in the ED case too. “Put up the application for reply by the CBI/ED and disposal on 16 April as prayed. Till then, the applicant shall not be arrested in the instant case,” the judge said in the orders.

Arguing in the CBI case earlier in the day, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, appearing for Karti, said that there was neither any allegation against Karti in the Aircel Maxis case nor there was anything to show that he knew the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) officials.

He argued that Karti’s name has not figured in any FIR (first information report) in the case and he was only called by the CBI as a witness in 2014. “I am entitled to protection till the time they (CBI) demonstrate anything against me in the court,” Sibal said.

Opposing his contention, CBI public prosecutor K.K. Goel said the application of Karti was defective and not maintainable for interim relief.

In the ED case, senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam, also appearing for Karti, argued that Karti has cooperated in the other matters as well and there was no question that he would flee the county or tamper with evidence.

ED counsel Nitesh Rana too opposed the anticipatory bail plea and said Karti’s counsel have failed to demonstrate on what basis he apprehends his immediate arrest in the case. “The application is wholly without merit,” he said while seeking three weeks time to reply to the plea.

Former finance minister P.Chidambaram, also a senior advocate himself, was present in the court room along with his wife Nalini Chidambaram seeking relief for his son. Both were in advocate’s attire. While senior Chidambaram wore black coat and trousers, Nalini was seen wearing an advocate’s black robe. Besides them, a battery of senior lawyers appeared in the court for Karti, including Sibal, Subramanium, Salman Khurshid, also a Congress leader, and Mohit Mathur to secure anticipatory bail for him.

During the hearing, Sibal also referred to the 2 February 2017 verdict of the court which had discharged former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother Kalanithi in the Aircel Maxis case and said after this order, no FIR was lodged by the agencies.

Hours after being granted bail by the Delhi high court in the INX media case, Karti had yesterday filed a plea seeking protection from arrest in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have lodged cases in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

The matter pertains to grant of FIPB clearance to firm M/S Global Communication Holding Services Ltd for investment in Aircel.

In September 2015 the CBI had filed its status report regarding probe into FIPB approvals in Aircel Maxis case. The agency had in June 2016 also issued notice to A Palaniappan, director of Chess Management Services, a company promoted by Karti.",Karti Chidambaram gets anticipatory bail till 16 April in Aircel Maxis case,"['16', 'anticipatory', 'shall', 'karti', 'aircel', 'weeks', 'cbi', 'matter', 'senior', 'gets', 'case', 'bail', 'sibal', 'chidambaram', 'till', 'maxis', 'court']","Karti Chidambaram was on Friday given bail by the high court in the INX Media case.

New Delhi: In an attempt to boost domestic cooking gas consumption under the marque Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), or Ujjwala scheme, state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Friday announced deferment of loan recovery up to six refills.

Under the Ujjwala scheme—a key welfare programme of the centre for poor women—many availing an equated monthly instalment (EMI) facility for meeting the cost of stove and first refills were paying market price for refills till the loan repayment was made.

This was resulting in some consumers becoming averse to such refills.

“As per the data available, about 70% of the PMUY customers have availed interest-free loan facility provided by OMCs towards financing LPG stove and/or first LPG cost. Under the scheme, OMCs are recovering the subsidy amount provided on subsequent refills from beneficiaries who have taken loan and adjusting the same towards the repayment of the loan,” state-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd said in a statement on Friday.

PMUY, launched in 2016, aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with LPG, so that they are protected from smoke while cooking or from having to go into unsafe areas to collect firewood.

“Hence, 70% Ujjwala beneficiaries purchase refills at market price until their loan is paid back. Paying the market price for the initial few refills is an additional hurdle that was coming in the way of their shift towards cleaner fuel, resulting in periodic slips back to biomass,” the statement added.

Under the scheme, the government aims to provide cooking gas to poor households and has covered 713 districts.

The scheme aims to replace cooking fuels, used mostly in rural India, with clean liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

Ujjwala scheme provides financial support of Rs1,600 for each cooking gas connection to eligible households. The connections are given in the name of the women heads of the households.

“Keeping in line with the spirit of PMUY scheme and the country’s goal to achieving universal LPG penetration by 2022 , OMCs have announced today to defer recovery of loan amount from Ujjwala beneficiaries for next six refills starting from 1 April 2018,” the statement said.

The importance of the LPG programme is evident from the fact that Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his 2018-19 Union Budget expanded the scope of Ujjwala to 80 million women, from 50 million earlier. So far, over 35.11 million women have been given connections under the scheme.

“Amount transferred under various Direct Benefits Transfer schemes increased by 25 times since the Modi Govt took over. #PAHAL, the largest DBT scheme in the world run by @PetroleumMin is the largest contributor,” oil and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted on Friday.

The scheme has been gaining traction. Mint reported on 6 Match about increased use of cooking gas may shrink the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in India, based on the statistics from the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) on TB prevalence. The NFHS-4 (2015-16) showed a great variation of TB prevalence in accordance with the type of cooking fuel used at home. TB was more common in homes using solid cooking fuels than using clean fuels.

With more people dieing of TB in India than any other country, India has been facing the problem of untimely deaths to unclean cooking fuels.

“Getting an LPG connection is a onetime decision; getting a refill is a decision that is to be made afresh every month or so taking into account several factors including any emergency expenditure that the family needs to prioritise. The first year of using LPG is crucial in a household’s journey from unclean to clean cooking fuel,” the statement added.","Ujjawala scheme: Indian Oil, others defer loan recovery up to 6 LPG refills","['lpg', 'recovery', 'indian', 'loan', 'cooking', 'refills', 'oil', 'gas', 'defer', 'ujjawala', 'scheme', 'statement', 'ujjwala', 'tb', 'women']","Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: In an attempt to boost domestic cooking gas consumption under the marque Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), or Ujjwala scheme, state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Friday announced deferment of loan recovery up to six refills.

New Delhi: A draft defence production policy put out by the government proposes to increase the foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in niche technology areas to 74% under the automatic route, in a bid to boost local manufacturing and catapult India into the league of countries housing top defence and aerospace industries.

At present, the FDI cap for the defence sector is 49% under the automatic route for all categories.

The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018, which was made public late on Thursday, aims to “create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative”.

It also aims to “facilitate faster absorption of technology and create a tiered defence industrial ecosystem in the country”, besides reducing the “dependence on imports” to “achieve self-reliance”.

India is currently the top importer of defence hardware in the world (according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been running a campaign with the goal of increasing the share of local manufacturing in the defence sector to create more jobs.

“It’s a bit ambitious in scope. The targets set will be very difficult to realize in their entirety,” said C. Uday Bhaskar, a former navy commodore and currently director of Delhi-based think tank Society for Policy Studies.

According to the policy, India hopes to achieve a turnover of Rs1.7 trillion in defence goods and services by 2025. It has a goal of becoming an arms exporter to the tune of Rs35,000 crore in defence goods and services by 2025.

By giving a leg-up to defence manufacturing, Asia’s third largest economy also hopes to transform itself into a “global leader in cyberspace and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies”.

The government is targeting achieving self-reliance in the development and manufacture of fighter aircraft, medium-lift and utility helicopters, warships, land combat vehicles, autonomous weapon systems, missiles, guns, small arms, ammunition, explosives, surveillance, electronic warfare and communication systems and night fighting equipment.

To achieve all these goals and to make it easier to do business in the area of defence for innovators, small- and medium-sized enterprises, the policy proposes to bring in enabling provisions to ensure start-ups and small enterprises participate “without having restrictions of turnover” or “prior experience”.

The government will list its requirements in terms of platforms and weapon systems for the next decade to help private sector companies understand the opportunities.

It will also simplify procedures for private firms to enter defence production, i.e., liberalize the regime by issuing licences in 30 days and pruning no-go areas to a small ‘negative list’ for licensing.

The government will also do away with capacity assessment, except for critical projects. It will introduce earnest money deposits and performance guarantees as safeguards for others.

With regard to offsets, the government has proposed to set up an ombudsman for resolving all such claims. Offsets—investments through a local partner to set up an ecosystem of suppliers—would be investment linked.

In the area of taxation, the government has proposed rationalization of taxes on import of capital goods for services and inputs for defence and aims to prevent inversion of taxes.",Draft defence production policy aims to raise FDI cap in niche tech to 74%,"['raise', 'production', 'draft', 'create', 'tech', 'fdi', 'aims', 'defence', 'india', 'small', 'services', 'systems', 'set', 'niche', 'cap', 'policy']","The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018 aims to ‘create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative’.

It is a fresh example of tighter EU rules for technology giants following reports that a political consultancy misused the data of 50 million Facebook users in a bid to influence the 2016 US presidential election.

The proposal would extend the application of EU consumer law to “free” digital services for which consumers provide their personal data instead of paying with money, such as cloud storage services, social media and email accounts.

“Given the increasing economic value of personal data, those services are not simply ‘free’”, said the document seen by Reuters and due to be presented next month.

The proposal would give consumers the right to pre-contractual information and to cancel contracts within 14 days.

It would also require member states to ensure that their national consumer authorities can levy fines of at least 4% of annual turnover, in line with those foreseen under an EU data protection law set to enter into force in May.

The European Commission is also planning a new law regulating the commercial practices of online platforms with smaller businesses, seeking to curtail their huge market power.

EU consumer authorities have been pressing Facebook, Twitter and Google to improve their user terms since last year. While Google’s changes were deemed sufficient, those of Facebook and Twitter only partially addressed the authorities’ concerns. No enforcement action has been taken so far.

The proposal, if agreed by the European Parliament and member states, would also give consumer authorities more teeth to deal with scandals such as Dieselgate, where German carmaker Volkswagen cheated emissions tests.

The Dutch regulator fined Volkswagen €450,000 ($554,085.00) for misleading consumers who bought its diesel cars, the maximum fine possible.

By contrast, VW has pledged billions of dollars to compensate owners of its diesel cars in the United States.

“The available penalties for infringements of consumer law are very different across the EU, and are often set at a low level,” the document says.

“As a result, their deterrence in some countries is also low.” Reuters","EU plans tougher consumer laws for Facebook, Gmail","['proposal', 'data', 'authorities', 'law', 'plans', 'facebook', 'services', 'planning', 'tougher', 'gmail', 'consumer', 'laws', 'european', 'eu']","Photo: ReutersBrussels: The European Union is planning to apply tougher consumer laws to social media networks and email providers like Facebook and Google’s Gmail as scrutiny of data protection grows in the wake of an outcry over Facebook’s handling of data.

31,US shouldn’t shut the door on Chinese students,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/CFdzyo1DpGAxOEVeYHgvgM/US-shouldnt-shut-the-door-on-Chinese-students.html,Chinese students in US spend at least $12 billion a year on tuition and living expenses—money that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in and around college campuses,"US President Donald Trump’s national security strategy calls for the government to consider restrictions on “foreign STEM students from designated countries to ensure that intellectual property is not transferred to our competitors”. Photo: Reuters

As part of its continuing campaign to prevent China from stealing American intellectual property, President Donald Trump’s administration is considering restrictions on the number of Chinese citizens enrolled at US colleges and universities. Targeting foreign students will undermine US competitiveness, not enhance it.

Of the 1 million foreign nationals enrolled at US schools, nearly one-third are from China—double the number of any other country. Chinese students receive 10% of all doctorates awarded in the US, most of them in science and engineering. Some 80% of Chinese doctoral holders stay in the US and work after they earn their degrees. There are more Chinese engineers working on artificial intelligence at US technology companies than in all of China.

The gains to the US economy aren’t limited to Silicon Valley. Chinese students spend at least $12 billion a year on tuition and living expenses—money that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in and around college campuses. High fees for international students subsidize tuition for US citizens and—until recently—have helped public universities offset cuts in government funding.

Such benefits are largely dismissed by those who cast Chinese students in the US as national security threats. President Trump’s national security strategy calls for the government to consider restrictions on “foreign STEM students from designated countries to ensure that intellectual property is not transferred to our competitors.”

The US can and should do more to counter Chinese theft of American trade secrets. But only a tiny fraction of students from China have ever been charged with illegal activity. Singling them out would be both discriminatory and dangerous, potentially fuelling suspicion of law-abiding Americans of Chinese descent.

The most sensible strategy to protect the country’s intellectual property isn’t to keep talented foreign students out, but to encourage them to stay in the US and put their knowledge to use—by joining the workforce or starting a business. That’s the purpose of the optional practical training program, which allows foreign students who earn degrees in technical fields to work in the US for up to three years. The Trump administration, true to form, wants to cut the program instead.

Whether the president imposes new quotas on Chinese students, the goal of some of his advisers seems clear: to make “designated” foreigners unwelcome on US campuses. That’s not only un-American, but also self-defeating.

32,A graphic biography of India’s Iron Lady: Indira Gandhi,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/kXfWywBfavJJ73EeVcGRsI/A-graphic-biography-of-Indias-Iron-Lady-Indira-Gandhi.html,A new graphic biography of Indira Gandhi seeks to humanize her towering political legacy,"Indira.

Apopulist leader will always have popular tales told about her. My mother, an ardent fan of Indira Gandhi, has many. Some include the adventures of my grandfather, a policeman who served as Gandhi’s bodyguard on occasion, and also led teams that went around arresting opposition leaders on the eve of the Emergency. Indira, a new graphic novel that serves as a biography of the inimitable Mrs Gandhi, similarly tells many tales about her, and, in doing so, seeks to bring her down to earth.

The book, a collaboration between writer Devapriya Roy and artist and illustrator Priya Kuriyan, works on multiple levels. At its most basic, it’s a straight biography, chronicling the life and times of Gandhi, from her birth into the then nascent pre-eminent political family of India, right up to her assassination and its repercussions. Simultaneously, it uses a fictional framing device of a young girl called Indira who is set a school assignment to find out more about her name. This gets her interested in her famous namesake. This recurring plot line, which is told in prose, gives the reader a chance to look at Gandhi as a person—a complex, ruthless, yet personable enigma.

In this storyline, the authors also use a meta-textual conceit—they include themselves and their quest to research and get the book written. And well they might, because Roy’s and Kuriyan’s partnership is a marriage of convenience. Commissioned to work on this book, and assigned to work with each other, the authors clearly had to find some common ground and narrative voice to make the book work. To a large extent, their collaboration succeeds. The image of Gandhi that emerges in the biography is fleshed out and considerate, if sympathetic to her paternalistic view of Indian democracy and politics. The art is in the vein of Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis books, dominated by black and white pencil sketches and line drawings. These are sometimes leavened by the use of saturating colours, usually when the narrative seeks to highlight a pivotal moment in Gandhi’s life, like the Nehru family’s embrace of swadeshi, the death of Gandhi’s mother, or when Gandhi sees a tiger during a safari in the Pench National Park.

Certain narrative strategies don’t work, like the one-dimensional group of friends that the authors use to comment on the Emergency and Operation Bluestar. It’s a tired device, with the four representing dissenting viewpoints while being utter ciphers as characters. Also, the Emergency, the Congress’ loss in the 1977 election, and its subsequent victory in 1980, are all dealt with quite perfunctorily, almost as if the writers were running out of time and space to finish Gandhi’s story.

That said, the narrative admittedly seeks to highlight Gandhi’s personal journey. Seen through the eyes of a child, this would be more heroic than critical. The received wisdom about Gandhi, among both her admirers and detractors, is her indomitable will to win. Through much of her life, she was written off as being weak, indecisive and tractable, primarily on account of her gender, only to prove people spectacularly wrong. That’s the line taken by this book as well. The most affecting bit, though, comes right at the end, when Gandhi’s assassination is depicted through the eyes of a young Priyanka Gandhi. The authors had spoken to her for the book, and the depiction we get, of a beloved grandmother and a young girl’s inexplicable grief and loss, is moving.",A graphic biography of India’s Iron Lady: Indira Gandhi,"['indias', 'iron', 'work', 'biography', 'authors', 'book', 'graphic', 'lady', 'life', 'gandhis', 'line', 'narrative', 'gandhi', 'young', 'seeks', 'indira']","My mother, an ardent fan of Indira Gandhi, has many.

33,Man Booker Prize: The ‘priziest prize’ turns 50 in style,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/GiuH8x6xHECeuzFiDI10sK/Man-Booker-Prize-The-priziest-prize-turns-50-in-style.html,The Man Booker Prize Foundation has announced a one-off ‘golden’ prize,"Salman Rushdie at the Frankfurt Book Fair, 2017.

To mark 50 years of the prize, the Man Booker Prize Foundation recently announced a one-off “golden” prize, placing the backlist of winners in a battle of the best—and bookish social media in a battle of its own.

Five judges—Robert McCrum, Lemn Sissay, Kamila Shamsie, Simon Mayo and Hollie McNish—have been appointed for the mammoth task and assigned a decade each, from the 1970s-2010s, to evaluate. The idea is to pick a winner amongst the winning books of a decade, resulting in a “Golden Five” shortlist (scheduled to be announced at the 2018 edition of the Hay Festival on 26 May). The shortlist will be subjected to a month-long public vote and the crème de la crème will be celebrated at the close of the Man Booker 50 festival (6-8 July, at London’s Southbank Centre).

“The Golden Man Booker will put all 51 winners—which are all still in print—back under the spotlight, to discover which of them has stood the test of time, remaining relevant to readers today,” says the press release. Indeed, in both their comments, Helena Kennedy (chair of the Booker Prize Foundation) and Luke Ellis (CEO of the Man Group) use words such as “endure”, “relevant” and “resonant”. With a time span that covers half a century, one that has witnessed substantial changes in literary prizes—including the Booker’s own trajectory—the question arises: How can one compare a 1969 winning book to a 2017 one and judge them both on the same criteria of “finest fiction”? While it’s easy to discern whether a winner from the 1970s, or even the 1980s, has “stood the test of time”, one can argue that fiction in the new millennium may be too nascent to be judged by the same yardstick.

Who, then, will be named the winner—the one who takes it all? The Guardian reported that “Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 for Midnight’s Children, is likely a favourite to win, having already won the Best of Booker award in 2008, to mark the prize’s 40th anniversary, and the Booker of Bookers in 1993, for its 25th birthday”. Literary scholar Stevie Marsden took to Twitter to express her frustration at the Booker’s tendency to re-reward titles: “Does it feel like they’re running out of ways to say ‘the best book’?” and “They’re just continuing a sycophantic cycle of a select canon. It’s boring. And I bet Midnight’s Children wins again.” And if the odds are against Rushdie, will one among the four double-winners of the Booker—J.G. Farrell (1970 and 1973), J.M. Coetzee (1983 and 1999), Peter Carey (1988 and 2001), and Hilary Mantel (2009 and 2012)—receive the crowning glory?

34,Formal suits take on brave new colours,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/MIIJ0XjIlwa31SiLaxQjnK/Formal-suits-take-on-brave-new-colours.html,It’s time to think beyond navy and grey,"There was a time when casual clothing was relegated to a single day of the work week—Friday—and suits dominated the rest. Today’s millennials have given rise to the laid-back swagger of streetwear paired with the workout clothes-as-everyday attire trend of athleisure, which means you’re as likely to see gym shorts at the office as the gym. Meanwhile, start-up culture has turned the hoodie into the new formal wear.

Which raises the question: Who needs a suit?

Much handwringing has been done over the death of your tried-and-true tailored two-piece, but don’t prepare the eulogy quite yet. Just look to the spring collection of British designer Paul Smith, which was filled with traditional suiting in colours ranging from saturated and rich to vibrant to squint-inducing. There was royal violet, traffic-cone orange, and neon yellow—often layered over exuberant floral printed shirts for added oomph.

Smith knows he’s going against the current. “I’m very aware people are dressing in an increasingly casual way, and the influence of sportswear is finding its way on to the catwalk and into fashion,” Smith says. “But tailoring really is at the heart of Paul Smith.” He slyly adds: “I wear a suit every single day.”

Smith says that his spring collection—now trickling into stores—was meant to convey a “sense of escapism and optimism”, serving as a “respite from all the madness going on in the world at the moment”. The core of the collection is a two-piece suit in the relaxed silhouettes that are currently favoured. “For most days and most purposes, a more classic navy suit is probably most suitable, but for the right occasion, a more adventurous option might be worth considering,” the designer says.

In addition to Paul Smith, such brands as Prada, Gucci, Tom Ford, Calvin Klein, and Boglioli (to mention just a few) showed suits in a rainbow’s array of colours, from eggplant purple to electric blue to baby pink (!). GQ magazine has given its approval to rapper Tyler, the Creator, wearing a green suit and David Beckham stepping out in a chocolate-brown two-piece. In an interesting twist, the skate and streetwear brand Supreme, which may traffic in hoodies and tees but is valued at $1 billion (around Rs6,510 crore), recently debuted its first suit. In addition to coming in sombre black, it will also come in Pepto-Bismol pink and emerald green. Expect to see it on the backs of cool kids later this year.

Most telling, of course, is that retailers are also on board, hoping to inject excitement into their suiting business. “What was interesting to see was how the suit was evolving: We saw roomier tailoring at Lemaire and Marni, whilst names better known for a sportier, youthful aesthetic—such as GmbH and Martine Rose—showed oversized, boxy blazers, which felt modern,” says Damien Paul, head of menswear at the British retailer Matches Fashion. “All this adds to the re-emergence of the suit as a fashion item, rather than office attire.”

Should you have a closet stuffed with navy, grey, and black suits, perhaps it’s time to start inching yourself out of your sartorial box and into uncharted waters. It’s not nearly as scary or difficult as it may seem.

“To be honest, it really comes down to how the guy is going to wear it,” explains Paul. “Does he work in a creative industry but needs something for client meetings? Or does he want something lighter in stone or khaki for a summer wedding? If the thought of a suit outside of grey or navy sounds scary, then I’d suggest a neutral palette: Beige, khaki, olive, and even a bolder royal blue can all work for most men. I’d also suggest keeping to a neat silhouette.”

Summer happens to be the ideal time to try this trend out, which is why the market is flooded with great options now. “I think the most unusual thing a man can do currently is wear a suit off-duty, which makes it a brilliantly relevant item to subvert,” Paul continues. “We are experiencing a re-ignited interest in the fashion suit, whether that be slim or oversized. Styling tailoring with a hoodie or jeans is the perfect bridge.”

When all is said and done, the colourful suit might just be the item that helps bring together the world of laid-back sportswear and more formal fashion gestures. After all, Smith has built a storied career on it, one that got him knighted. “In my opinion, style isn’t about dressing in a particular way. It’s about a state of mind and having confidence in the way you look. I’m a very down-to-earth and optimistic person, and so bright colour and vivid print has always been central to the clothes I design,” he says. “I know that most people gravitate towards the more classic colours and less statement-making prints, but it’s important that colour and print are part of the collection, as some people choose to express themselves with brightly coloured or printed clothes.” Bloomberg",Formal suits take on brave new colours,"['smith', 'suit', 'work', 'suits', 'way', 'twopiece', 'fashion', 'tailoring', 'formal', 'colours', 'paul', 'wear', 'brave']","There was a time when casual clothing was relegated to a single day of the work week—Friday—and suits dominated the rest.

35,Film Review: Hichki,https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/SYs2Uwnh1zidQZhI40hQZK/Film-Review-Hichki.html,Sidharth P Malhotra’s ‘Hichki’ hands out one lesson too many,"Rani Mukerji in a still from ‘Hichki’.

After Hindi Medium, Sidharth P Malhotra’s Hichki is the second film in 10 months whose narrative hinges on the Right to Education Act. This isn’t surprising—after all, our films have always felt they have the right to educate. Hichki’s opening minutes are a quick lesson in Tourette’s, a condition Naina (Rani Mukerji) has had since childhood. “Do you know anything about Tourette syndrome?” she asks the panel interviewing her for a teaching job (they haven’t). Not the most elegant screenwriting solution, and there are more lessons to come. We’re whisked into a flashback; young Naina is called on stage by her school principal after her vocal tics disrupt a play. Instead of reprimanding her as we assume he will, he says, “You come to school to learn, but today we have learnt something from you.”

After several rejections, Naina is hired as a teacher at St Notker’s, an elite Mumbai high school. This is only partly due to her qualifications, the principal admits. They’re in urgent need of a teacher to take charge of class 9F, a class with 14 “difficult” students from the nearby slum. Disadvantaged students, idealistic teacher: if you’ve seen To Sir, With Love or Dangerous Minds or Short Term 12, you’ll have a fair idea where this is headed. Thirty minutes or so of teacher trying to win class over, confrontation, tipping point, then a final sprint towards discovering of potential.

This might sound like a harsh assessment of an earnest film, but Hichki often comes across as parachute filmmaking—dropping in on a problem just long enough to prick the viewer’s conscience and make them feel like they’re watching something meaningful, but avoiding any sort of meaningful engagement. When no one turns up for a parent-teacher meeting, Naina goes to her students’ houses. The sequence that follows is a smooth assuaging of liberal guilt—not one parent voices the uncomfortable but believable opinion that they’d rather have their child out of school and earning.

As a contrast to 9F, screenwriters Malhotra, Anckur Chaudhry, Ambar Hadap and Ganesh Pandit populate section 9A with posh, fresh-faced students who look down on their economically disadvantaged peers (whether 9B, C, D and E are on a decreasing scale of nastiness is never addressed). The writers also give Naina an opposite number, the supercilious Wadia (Neeraj Kabi), who pops up every few scenes to mock her unconventional teaching techniques (boiled eggs to explain parabolas, basketballs for potential energy) and employ a series of classist euphemisms for her charges (he drops all pretence at the end, calling them “municipal trash”).

Cartoonish though he is, more than a few readers who’ve attended private school will remember teachers like Wadia—instinctively, unthinkingly class-conscious. If they’re being honest, some will also see glimpses of themselves in the students of 9A. Just because Hichki is guileless and corny doesn’t mean it isn’t knocking on the right door. But Hindi message films aren’t as simplistic as they used to be; just compare the detailed environments and relatively complex characters of Nil Battey Sannata or Secret Superstar with the generic slum and archetypes in this film.

The actors playing the students are wonderful, turning even the rank sentimentality of the later scenes into something watchable. Had the film been less interested in the un-illuminating struggle between Naina and her critical father, we might have been able to get to know the 14 better. But this is ultimately a film about Naina—her students, her solutions, her journey, her hichkis.",Film Review: Hichki,"['school', 'teacher', 'theyre', 'class', 'teaching', 'review', 'film', 'naina', 'students', 'hichki', 'right']","After Hindi Medium, Sidharth P Malhotra’s Hichki is the second film in 10 months whose narrative hinges on the Right to Education Act.

It might be sacrilege to make a declaration such as this but visiting the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican last week, I was more than a little underwhelmed by the mood of the place. The famous ceiling of this famous building is, no doubt, exquisite, what with Michelangelo reluctantly giving up his sculptor’s tools to paint its frescoes, neck craned for a full four years to achieve this 16th century feat. But the overall climate of the building today is disappointing. Part of the blame rests with my guide who, 2 hours earlier, had started to fan anticipation, dinning endless rules into my head—we could not speak inside the chapel, no questions could be asked, and the only sentiment permitted was unsmiling solemnity, textured with reverence and awe. As it happened, the chapel was all crowd, sweat, and refractory chatter, not helped by guards on loudspeakers shepherding people down the aisles. There was no room to stand, and before my stipulated time had elapsed, I decided to decamp, choosing fresh air and the sun over Michelangelo’s monumental art.

The crowds I saw during my visit to Rome did leave me thinking, however, about the deep enchantment Italy sustains for the world at large, droves of tourists digging deep in their pockets for the pleasure of consuming its cultural heritage (mass perspiration notwithstanding). At about a tenth the size of India, Italy is home to five times as many museums, and hosts five times more tourists than we do in our own, more extensive portion of the world. And that is the puzzling part—we have the Taj Mahal and we have Hampi; there is culture and there is cuisine; there are forts and palaces; and there are jewels and infinite objects to enthrall. Most importantly, there are fascinating stories. The ingredients are there, in other words, and yet we fail—to succumb to a vulgar word—to “showcase” the best of our national inheritance. Where are India’s museums, I wondered, and why are there no crowds thronging ancient buildings in such large numbers that guides must hiss and fume when someone prefers the air over awe? Why, if the overcrowded Louvre can draw nine million visitors in a year, do our museums attract less than 100,000 visitors?

It is estimated that India is home to 800-1,000 museums, a minor figure when even our former colonizers in Britain own more than twice that number, while our current rival, China, has proactively established 4,000. Italy has a museum for every 13,000 citizens; India has perhaps one for every 1.3 million. It is another matter that most would not complain about this shortfall given the dreary experience that a visit to our museums involves—besides lines of restless schoolchildren compelled to tour dusty halls and look interested, we have a problem in the way we run institutions of art and culture. Some of it is bureaucracy—the Union ministry of culture oversees a large number of museums, but there are many under other ministries, not to speak of dozens run by local authorities. Budgetary allocations are abysmal—this year, the culture minister has Rs2,843 crore to disburse (about the same as the cost of an extravagant statue planned in Mumbai), of which museums will receive an even smaller slice after allocations to archives, the archaeological survey and other departments are made. In comparison, Italy earned €200 million (around Rs1,600 crore) through sales of entry tickets alone.

Ticketing is a complicated subject. On the one hand is the argument that art and heritage must remain accessible—Rs20, in a poor country, may already seem like a lot. But if there is no revenue of significance from tickets, and if funding from “above” is inadequate, we can at best watch and sigh as our cultural resources crumble into dust—two years ago, it was discovered that 24 monuments had gone “missing” altogether. Occasionally, of course, there are bursts of energy, as when hundreds of crores were invested for the “state of the art” Bihar Museum, or after a generous allocation was made for the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 2014 (where, ironically, millennia-old objects were damaged by inexpert handling only a year later). And then there are private museums, though how accessible these will be to modestly heeled audiences is uncertain.

The question is, do we allow cheaper access while the institutions themselves collapse, when smarter ticketing, and the superior quality this ensures, might actually increase the number of visitors? Surely museum passes could be priced at least at par with the average movie ticket, or will the piety associated with cheap entry survive as a smokescreen for our collective failure to do a better job?

There have been encouraging sounds about “rescuing” India’s museums through public-private partnerships, though attempts at pulling these off have not succeeded. One group in Bengaluru, which was to develop the iconic Venkatappa Art Gallery, backed by the city’s leading philanthropists, eventually pulled out two years ago after protests that their intention was to turn the decrepit institution into a “wine and cheese” place. The project fell through, while under leaky roofs with peeling plaster, a set of people certainly felt they had gained a moral victory, oblivious perhaps to a greater loss. That, then, is the sad reality of India’s squandered cultural resources and undersold historical inheritance—in the Sistine Chapel or at the Louvre, it is the want of room that spurs an urge to walk out. In India, home to the most phenomenal of wonders, the question, given the state of our museums, is whether, in the first place, most of us would even consider walking in.

There have been encouraging sounds about “rescuing” India’s museums through public-private partnerships, though attempts at pulling these off have not succeeded.
That, then, is the sad reality of India’s squandered cultural resources and undersold historical inheritance—in the Sistine Chapel or at the Louvre, it is the want of room that spurs an urge to walk out.",2018-03-23 15:33:01+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Svalbard Global Seed Vault: the seeds of our future,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/eVM6U13YvxeSj35cbqo01O/Svalbard-Global-Seed-Vault-the-seeds-of-our-future.html,"As the Svalbard Global Seed Vault completes a decade, we find out if the idea of building a similar bank in India is still viable","Google Maps search results for Svalbard make for an intriguing sight. This small Norwegian archipelago has the Greenland Sea on one side and the Arctic Ocean on the other. There are scattered patches of green—the mountains and fjords—that are easily overshadowed by the white, which represents the extreme Arctic climate in Svalbard. More than half of the archipelago is covered with glaciers.

On one of these islands, deep inside a sandstone mountain, a secure facility holds the future of the agricultural world’s genetic resources. With seed samples from more than 76 global depositor institutes, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located on the Spitzbergen island, practically holds the world’s agricultural history—and perhaps the future.

The vault, which completed 10 years in February, is owned by the Norwegian government. The facility is managed through an agreement between the Norwegian ministry of agriculture and food, the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre (NordGen), and the Crop Trust (formerly known as the Global Crop Diversity Trust).

Speaking to Lounge in a Skype call, Åsmund Asdal, Svalbard Global Seed Vault coordinator, explains why there is a need to preserve new varieties of crops and seeds.

“Gene banks have been collecting seeds, multiplying and distributing them for breeding and research for more than 50 years. Some gene banks were established even before World War II. Genetic resources of crops are the raw material that agricultural breeders and researchers need to develop the varieties. We need these varieties because of climate change, increasing food production, dry and wet climate conditions, new plant diseases, and so on,” says Asdal.

Asdal says the vault, described as everything from the “doomsday vault” to a “Noah’s Ark” for the world’s seeds, offers a safe place for duplicate samples of seeds that are conserved in gene banks across the world.

The seed vault follows a simple system. All gene banks that deposit their seeds still technically own them. They can withdraw them in case of an emergency. A recent example comes from war-stricken Syria, where the gene bank in Aleppo was left inaccessible in 2015. The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda), which handles the gene bank in Aleppo and other research centres globally, took seed samples that had been deposited at Svalbard to duplicate the seed collection in Aleppo at gene banks in Lebanon and Morocco. Once the fresh seeds were successfully regrown at these two locations, they were deposited again at Svalbard last year, with more seeds expected this year.

On its 10th anniversary, 77,671 seed samples were added to the vault. With this, the total number of samples deposited crossed one million—1,060,987. But, over the last three years, Icarda has withdrawn 92,430 seed samples for the gene banks at Morocco and Lebanon, bringing the current count of seed samples to 968,557.

“It’s quite a simple project in a big international system for improving agriculture,” adds Asdal, who has been the coordinator since 2015.

Climate factor

The vault has been carved inside a mountain mass that has permafrost, with a temperature of minus 3-4 degrees Celsius. The seed storage area, comprising three halls, also has an additional cooling system, which keeps the temperature at minus 18 degrees Celsius.

The first portion of the vault is an artificially built tunnel that is not watertight and has experienced water-logging during rainfall or warmer seasons in recent years. But the Norwegian government, Asdal says, has now announced that it will spend around 100 million Norwegian krone (Rs6.5 crore) to make the tunnel watertight.

Will climate change have a big impact on the permafrost that naturally keeps the temperature inside the seed vault below absolute zero?

“Climate change is a large problem all over the world. Scientists have indicated that the Arctic region is facing more problems than other parts of the world. The Longyearbyen society, which is a village in Svalbard, faces problems since a lot of the buildings are built on permafrost. They are also affected by snow slides. But as far as the seed vault is concerned, we’ll probably need to have more electricity to keep the temperatures at minus 18 degrees Celsius. So, as long as there’s civilization, electricity and staff at Longyearbyen, I don’t see any problems for the vault,” says Asdal.

Seed viability is another key factor. This basically refers to the ability of a seed to germinate, which can be affected by the surrounding environmental conditions. Apart from pathogens and plant diseases, moisture or excessive heat can fatally damage seeds.

“Seeds do not live forever. Gene banks regularly monitor the viability of their seeds. The storage conditions at Svalbard are the same as at these gene banks. When a gene bank tests their seeds and sees that a seed sample is going to lose viability, they’ll have to multiply and regenerate new seeds for themselves. They will also replace the same samples at Svalbard. We are not doing any testing at Svalbard,” Asdal explains.

In simple words, testing the seeds for viability and germination is essentially the responsibility of the gene banks. In India, much of the onus is on the national seed bank in Delhi and Icrisat (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) in Bengaluru.

Indian pigeon pea

Apart from the national seed bank at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) in Delhi, India has its own mini version of the seed vault in Chang-La, about 75km from Leh. This national permafrost repository was started in 2009 by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), in collaboration with the NBPGR.

While the national seed bank has more than 1,500 crop species in the form of almost 400,000 seeds, the repository at Chang-La holds close to 5,000 seed samples from different plant species.

“The seed lines at the gene bank at Pusa have a huge diversity of crops—rice, wheat, tuber crops, pulses, oilseeds, fruit crops and medicinal plants,” says K.C. Bansal, former director, NBPGR.

Bansal was part of the delegation that carried the first official Indian deposit to the Svalbard seed vault in 2014. He was accompanied by Manas K. Mandal, then director general, life sciences, DRDO, and Ashish Bahuguna, then Union agricultural secretary. “The seed vault in Svalbard is an engineering marvel. The idea was to also see if we could build a similar gene bank on a small scale in the Himalayas,” Bansal says.

The first deposit from India at Svalbard had the pigeon pea or arhar dal. “It’s one of the most prominent crops in our country. We had carried around 25 accession samples back then,” he adds.

While there has been no word on a bigger repository, the DRDO did start an extreme altitude research centre in Chang-La in 2015. At 17,600ft above sea level, this is the world’s highest terrestrial research and development (R&D) centre, according to a Press Trust Of India report quoted in the Hindustan Times.

The report adds that the centre was established by the Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (Dihar), Leh, which is part of the DRDO. Apart from R&D work in food and agriculture, other life sciences activities that were proposed to be conducted at this centre included conservation of plant genetic resources, endangered extreme altitude medicinal plants, and soil-less micro-farming.

Bansal says building a facility similar to Svalbard isn’t an easy task. One of the most important things will be to have security from the point of view of electricity and energy conservation, since gene banks rely heavily on artificial cooling systems.

“The idea is still valid. (But) we’ll have to keep in mind the nearby border areas, and that the zone is highly seismic. All these angles are really important. Such a big project will need inputs from not only scientists, but engineers, earth sciences experts, and so on. Once the technology we have at our disposal matures, I am sure we’ll make more progress.”",Svalbard Global Seed Vault: the seeds of our future,"['research', 'seed', 'seeds', 'samples', 'banks', 'global', 'future', 'gene', 'vault', 'crops', 'svalbard', 'bank']","With seed samples from more than 76 global depositor institutes, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, located on the Spitzbergen island, practically holds the world’s agricultural history—and perhaps the future.

38,Alt-rock favourites The Breeders are back,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/oywqkk0HU3lSlWN0r0TE7N/Altrock-favourites-The-Breeders-are-back.html,With a classic line-up and a killer new album,"Despite the critical success of Last Splash, The Breeders went their separate ways in 1994.

After years of playing stellar bass and second fiddle to Black Francis in the Pixies, one of the most idiosyncratic alt-rock bands of the 1980s, Kim Deal decided to branch out on her own. She recorded a set of demos with Tanya Donelly (of The Throwing Muses) and violinist Carrie Bradley. With Josephine Wiggs on bass, this became the first Breeders album, Pod (1990). The following year, the Pixies disbanded, Donnelly and Bradley left The Breeders, and Kelley Deal (Kim’s sister) and Jim McPherson joined. This was the line-up that recorded Last Splash, arguably the band’ best album, bursting with hooks and eccentricities and supplying an alt-rock barnstormer for the ages in Cannonball.

Despite the critical success of Last Splash, The Breeders went their separate ways in 1994. The Deal sisters reunited for two albums, Title TK (2001) and Mountain Battles (2008). But the Last Splash line-up, the tightest iteration of the band, never got back together—until now. On All Nerve, their first studio album in a decade, the group plays to its strengths: the subversion of rock and pop clichés, the off-kilter humour, and Kim’s singularly charming voice, which is always threatening to veer off pitch.

Nervous Mary is pure Breeders, with its churning riff, plangent guitars and frankly strange lyrics (Madrid in my nose/black lung in my hand). It makes sense that the album would open with it, though I wish they’d opted for track 2 instead. “Good morning!” their founder-singer-guitarist yells, kicking off Wait In The Car, a blast of pure punk pop and Kim Deal weirdness (Always struggle with the right word/Meow meow meow meow meow). It’s over in 2 minutes, but it sounds like the work of a young band, and like the old band we know, which is all one can really ask for.

The loud/soft dynamic in the songs of The Breeders (and the Pixies before them) was hugely influential—Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain was a vocal fan of both bands. Spacewoman is the best example of this on the album, with the song’s gentle verses giving way to grungy guitars in the chorus. Dawn: Making An Effort shimmers unexpectedly, like a shoegaze number; Howl At The Summit has the demented whine of I Am The Walrus (an outright Beatles cover, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, featured on Pod). The one cover on this album is a rarity: German commune rock band Amon Düül II’s Archangel Thunderbird. It’s more straightforward than their cover—almost a critique—of Aerosmith’s Lord Of The Thighs, but is nonetheless dynamic, with McPherson’s frenetic drumming recalling his work on Cannonball.

All Nerve clocks in at 31 minutes; six of its 11 tracks are under the 3-minute mark. Given this relatively slim running time, you might wish Skinhead #2 built to a point, or that the menacing Metagoth didn’t sound like a retread of the Pixies’ Gouge Away. But these are small quibbles. It’s invigorating to be in The Breeders’ company again, especially since their sound—which informs the approach of hip new artists like The Courtneys and Courtney Barnett—has hardly dated. Because the band has dropped albums after long hiatuses, they’ve never had to reinvent themselves. As a reminder, a cheery “Good morning” is all that’s needed.",Alt-rock favourites The Breeders are back,"['deal', 'album', 'breeders', 'work', 'went', 'meow', 'band', 'splash', 'favourites', 'pixies', 'wish', 'altrock']","Despite the critical success of Last Splash, The Breeders went their separate ways in 1994.

39,Meet the folks behind the experimental indie label ‘nrtya’,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/oGc9f3RDwZyDs0hCaaJmRO/Meet-the-folks-behind-the-experimental-indie-label-nrtya.html,‘Nrtya’ is emerging as a patron for home-grown musicians,"Singer-songwriter Aditi Ramesh is managed by the indie label nrtya.

Independent music label nrtya’s SoundCloud stream offers a sonic trip down the rabbit hole. You’ll find yourself being lulled by the gentle, atmospheric intros of Sq. Feet’s EP Motion, jolted by the glitchy interlude in The Mellow Turtle’s otherwise undramatic single Laced, and bobbing along to the cinematic swells in Hill of Non’s Lost In Hind. It’s a curious assemblage, with curiouser artist identities like Salty Prawns and Owlist.

This busy, predominantly electronic soundscape spans across genres like trip-hop, ambient, techno and acid-jazz, and features upcoming artists from the Indian metros and beyond. Some of these experiments, though earnest, are slightly rough around the edges, but nrtya’s rapid pace of releases ensures a wide sample range to choose from.

The label was founded last May by Mumbai-based Raghu Vamshi, Sharan Punjabi and Parth Taco, all three with close ties to the independent music scene. Vamshi and Punjabi are artists themselves—they make up the electronic act Tansane—while Taco is a former music programming consultant. Tansane’s debut EP, A Series Of Happenings, was the trio’s first release as nrtya, a name that encompasses their eclectic vision. “Nrtya signifies the cosmic dance of the universe, containing the five principles of eternal energy—creation, preservation, destruction, illusion and emancipation. It signifies the eternal timeless nature of art over the rise and fall of civilizations,” explains Punjabi.

In the 10 months since nrtya’s launch, the label has featured over 100 releases on its social media pages by more than 30 artists, and they manage 12 of them. Vamshi confirms both numbers are set to spike considerably in the coming months. “There is so much quality music coming out by musicians who are not known at all,” he says. “People have been finding nrtya and sending us their demos, like Ranchi-based Rishabh Lohia (aka The Mellow Turtle). We help artists at different stages of their evolution, but since many producers are not performers, there has to be a unique live element involved for us to also manage them.”

Three such live acts have been gaining ground on the festival scene. Aditi Ramesh—also part of the new all-girls’ outfit Ladies Compartment—stands out as a powerhouse vocalist who can effortlessly infuse Carnatic interludes into whimsical jazz and blues compositions. After the launch of their debut EP, Mumbai-based Nirmit Shah and Sid Shirodkar of Ape Echoes found a spot on the 2017 Magnetic Fields Festival line-up, while prodigal guitarist Rhythm Shaw performed at the Shillong edition of the 2017 Bacardi NH7 Weekender.

In the last few years, there has been a heartening increase in the number of independent labels in India. Delhi-based Azadi Records propelled home-grown, politically conscious acts like Naezy and Prabh Deep to the mainstream while Bengaluru’s Consolidate Records forefronted young electronic artists such as Disco Puppet. A relative old-timer, Pagal Haina, has added to its roster of singer-songwriters (Prateek Kuhad, Aditi Veena) with Rounak Maiti, who released the folksy album Bengali Cowboy last year.

According to Vamshi, this sprouting of new and diverse labels is a first step towards building a more substantial audience for home-grown music. “Even if 20 more labels start tomorrow, that’s still not enough. We need hundreds of labels and agencies for there to be a significant change. It’s not going to be 5-10 labels in India that are going to inform the listening culture evolution. Our goal is to increase the bubble of listeners that are consuming Indian music, and that doesn’t happen much apart from Bollywood.”

In comparison to other indie labels, nrtya’s brand of music is not instantly identifiable, functioning under an amorphous, genre-agnostic philosophy in an increasing crowded electronic space. “We don’t believe there is an over-representation of electronic acts,” argues Vamshi. “The lines between the production and performance of electronic and acoustic elements are blurring and there is definitely more of an audience for experimental artists.”

In the months to come, nrtya plans to add to their event properties like “mrtya by nrtya” (featuring a genre-based line-up) and spotlight young artists from music schools. “Next week, we’re releasing an amazing track by Kali Mirch, these are students of the Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music in Chennai,” says Vamshi.

With a collective outreach of around 25,000 on all their social media channels, the label is poised for a gradual upward graph. For young music start-ups, Vamshi prescribes a patient, passionate vision, one that outweighs a hunger for numbers. “It’s not always about how famous our artists get or how many downloads they have. Success for an artist is also being able to create something authentic—and this itself is unbelievably difficult—so to see our artists do that makes us proud.”",Meet the folks behind the experimental indie label ‘nrtya’,"['nrtyas', 'nrtya', 'artists', 'meet', 'experimental', 'vamshi', 'electronic', 'music', 'labels', 'indie', 'label', 'months', 'young', 'folks']","Singer-songwriter Aditi Ramesh is managed by the indie label nrtya.

40,Spot killer snails and blue crabs on Mumbai’s shores,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/eVehlSnFgvCWZ6TNK7jjtL/Spot-killer-snails-and-blue-crabs-on-Mumbais-shores.html,Marine Life of Mumbai introduces citizens to the city’s biodiverse coastline,"Is that a brittle star?!” a keen-eyed environmental studies student enquires, crouching for a closer look of the slim, tentacled figure. Her exclamation draws the dozen DSLR-armed men and women who have descended on the jagged shores behind Mumbai’s Haji Ali Dargah to spot the city’s mysterious, neglected residents—its marine life. As the cameras position themselves for the perfect slant of light, another participant throws in a bit of trivia: “Some species of brittle stars are smaller than the food they eat. So their stomachs actually leave their bodies for them to digest the food outside.”

On these walks, organized by the Marine Life of Mumbai (MLOM), expect to find sea anemones and algae that betray evidence of the city’s uncontrolled pollution, sea slugs that have migrated to shallow waters, and unassuming but lethal Conus shells that might shoot venom into your bloodstream on contact (“touch nothing, you won’t even survive the trip to the hospital,” warns one of the volunteers). With committed marine-life enthusiasts for company, you can listen to debates over scientific names, interrupted by delighted squeals at rare sightings (a once-colourful gorgonian fan is gushed over) and comparisons of the health of the city’s biodiverse shores.

This citizen-driven initiative has been co-founded by marine biologist and researcher Abhishek Jamalabad, who used to work with WWF India; “sea captain” and marine conservationist Siddharth Chakravarty; and water sports instructor Pradip Patade, who has spent over 20 years exploring Mumbai’s shores, and leads this particular walk. After years of embarking on solitary sea excursions, and aligning with the city’s fisherfolk for updates on tides and unfamiliar catches, he finally decided to start documenting his findings.

“During Ganesh visarjan that year (2013), around 100 people were stung by jellyfish, stingray and eels. That’s when I dedicatedly started taking pictures of marine life in the city, since it is such an ignored, undocumented subject. Bombay beaches are only famous for their litter; no one really explores the shores,” says Patade.

The trio organizes regular coastal walks where participants photograph and share their sightings on the MLOM Facebook page; this data also aids in research studies. The monthly walks are spread over three shores—Carter Road, Haji Ali and Girgaon Chowpatty—and the schedules vary according to tidal patterns. Since it was set up last year, the MLOM has seen a rise in volunteer participation, with a motley crew of biology students, academics and curious citizens navigating jagged oyster beds and sandy shores for a glimpse of reticent hermit crabs, gelatinous nudibranches and bleached sea corals. Local children abandon their games to join the party with their own discoveries, carefully bagging a translucent mantis shrimp for the group to photograph before setting it free once again.

The MLOM also undertakes private walks to study the marine diversity of ecologically sensitive shores. “At the mouth of the Arabian Sea, where the new Shivaji (Shiv Smarak) statue is coming up…that place is heaven. I often paddle there with a sea kayak, once I was surrounded by a dozen dolphins. In the last few days, we have also spotted dolphins from Nariman Point,” says Patade. “There is marine life around—once people see the beauty, they will think of conservation. Students should come out of labs and actually explore the shores.”

41,The purple heart of the banana tree,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/eVcwDZXkoRi3TV39fqOv8M/The-purple-heart-of-the-banana-tree.html,"In Bengal, appreciating the banana blossom demands serious knife skills, patience and a sophisticated palate","As a child, I was a strangely acquiescent eater. I would eat my greens with uncommon alacrity and lap up insipid gruels without objection. My non-discriminatory eating policy was effusively extolled, even flaunted, in front of guests too. But what earned me the most enthusiastic nods of approval as a five-year-old was my obsessive love for mocha (banana blossom). I could give up all the kormas and kalias of the world for a bowl of ghee-soaked mochar ghonto (a dry preparation made with the banana blossom). My family took this as early proof of my evolved palate.

The weakness of the 15th century Vaishnava saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for mocha was legendary. In fact, the mocha is mentioned quite a few times in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, a biography of his life and teachings written by Krishnadas Kaviraja. Swami Vivekananda, too, was a fan and is believed to have proclaimed that in order to eat mochar dalna, “one could be born again and again”.

‘Mocha bhaate’ (boiled and mashed banana blossom).

My love for mocha wasn’t just gastronomic. I particularly enjoyed watching our cook clean and cut the mocha—she would smear mustard oil on her fingers and palm (to avoid staining from the sticky sap), yank out the large petals with seasoned flicks of her hand, one at a time, and carefully pull out the florets attached to the base. At times she would grumble about how she would never understand the hue and cry over the vegetable, and the time and labour that went into its preparation. “In our village,” she would say, “we feed these to the cows.” I would wait patiently till she had finely chopped up the last floret and dunked it in turmeric-infused water to prevent discolouration. I would then demand a couple of the gorgeous merlot petals to play with.

For a long time, in my mind, mocha was something “steadfastly Bengali”. Of course, that’s far from true. But it is true that the exalted culinary status, the cultural iconicity and sentimental value that Bengalis attach to the innocuous mocha, can hardly be seen elsewhere. Few cuisines use it as diversely and imaginatively. There was a time, elders reminisce, when “cutting and cleaning the mocha” was counted among the essential skills for all Bengali girls of marriageable age.

These days in Kolkata one can buy the mocha cleaned and chopped from the local bazaar, but many still shy away from preparing it at home because it’s time-consuming. The feted mochar ghonto (the best-known banana-blossom dish of Bengali origin) does make an obligatory appearance on menus at Bengali speciality restaurants. Yet, somehow, it doesn’t match up to the home-cooked versions to which cooks add their personal touches.

The best mochar ghonto I have tasted came out of my maternal grandmother’s kitchen. She liked cooking with the larger, meatier and tastier garbo mocha, which is cut from the tree just before the banana has matured. Sometimes, she would add black gram to her slightly sweet mochar ghonto, and finish it with a garnish of freshly grated coconut or crushed, deep-fried bori (sun-dried lentil pellets). Sometimes, she would add prawns to the mix. The dish was a lesson in subtlety and balance. Another of her specialities was the mochar paturi (mashed banana florets mixed with grated coconut, mustard paste and green chillies, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked on a griddle), reserved for special occasions. The mocha, like raw jackfruit and green bananas, would also be used to make koftas for rich curries.

Basically, my grandmother could construct an entire meal out of mocha. Her personal favourite was the innocuous mocha bhaate (boiled mocha mashed with salt, minced green chillies, a splash of mustard oil, and, sometimes, a blob of kasundi, or mustard relish) that she sometimes rustled up for herself. Her solitary, late-afternoon lunch would feature this bhaate with hot rice and ghee.

I could eat the mocha cooked in my grandma’s kitchen seven days a week. The only problem was that in our home, like many other Bengali households, it was strictly prohibited on Tuesdays and Saturdays. This was because of a rather grim tradition followed by many Hindu families in Bengal whereby if a person died on a Tuesday or a Saturday, a banana flower had to be placed near the body. As a result, Wednesdays were considered the best day to bring the mocha home in our family, for it could be relished over three days.

In a state known for its telebhaja, or fried snacks, the mochar chop has a somewhat exalted status. These crumbed patties made of a sweet and spicy banana-blossom stuffing were once among the chief attractions at neighbourhood chop-cutlet joints. Although it’s difficult to find a decent one these days, a few Bengali restaurants and wedding caterers have it on their menus. But it seems the mochar chop has a richer cousin. In his 19th century cookbook Pak Pranali, Bipradas Mukhopadhyay talks about the Mochar Mohan Chop, which is prepared like a regular mochar chop, except that it is loaded with luxurious ingredients like khoya, almonds, pistachio and fried in ghee.

Interestingly, author Utsa Ray, in her book Culinary Culture In Colonial India, writes about a rather unusual shukto (a bitter vegetable dish with a light broth) of eggplant, pumpkin, green banana and banana blossom spiced with asafoetida, cumin and fenugreek…”, mentioned in one of the versions of Chandi Mangal Kavya, an important work of medieval Bengali literature. Such recipes are rare these days, consigned to the pages of dusty old cookbooks or fading memories of grandmothers. It’s perhaps time to recreate them in our kitchens.

One banana to rule them all

All across India, wherever banana trees grow in abundance, the edible inflorescence also finds its way into the kitchen. In Kerala, a particularly popular dish is the banana blossom and green gram thoran (stir-fry), tempered with curry leaves and mustard, and loaded with fresh grated coconut. Tamil Nadu’s spicy banana blossom vazhaipoo poriyal is flavoured with sambhar masala and tempered with urad dal, mustard seeds and curry leaves, a perfect accompaniment to piping steamed rice and a dash of ghee. Kitchens in Karnataka’s Udupi district often have a chutney made with banana flower. Fortified with fresh coconut, ginger, chillies and sesame seeds, it’s a condiment that livens up the simplest meals.

The banana blossom is also quite well-known in the North-East. Assam has an interesting dish, the koldilere rondha paro manxo, a thick curry made with banana blossom and pigeon meat. And the Khasis of Meghalaya have a chutney which combines mashed banana flower with sesame seeds.",The purple heart of the banana tree,"['bengali', 'ghonto', 'purple', 'heart', 'mashed', 'banana', 'green', 'mustard', 'tree', 'mochar', 'dish', 'mocha', 'blossom']","But what earned me the most enthusiastic nods of approval as a five-year-old was my obsessive love for mocha (banana blossom).

Mumbai/New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday conducted searches at the Mumbai headquarters of Financial Technologies of India Ltd (FTIL), and the residences of Jignesh Shah (former chairman of FTIL), as well as those of former chairmen of the erstwhile Forward Markets Commission (FMC)—in connection with alleged irregularities in granting recognition to the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as a national commodity exchange, said two people aware of the development.

In an emailed response, FTIL, now known as 63 Moons Technologies Ltd, said the search was in connection with the matter of permission granted to MCX in 2003, and added it has full faith in the judiciary. “We find this surprising as the permission was granted 15 years ago when the country did not have a pan-India commodity exchange. The permission to set up a nationwide commodity exchange was not only granted to MCX but also three others—NCDEX, NMCE and N-BOT,” said a spokesperson for 63 Moons.

“We have already been forced to exit MCX in 2014 and all documents related to the permission are obviously with MCX. Despite this, the search is being conducted on us and our chairman emeritus (Jignesh Shah),” he said.

“During the search at Shah’s residence on Friday, CBI did not find any single incriminating material and/or document. The agency is being misled by vested interests trying to divert attention from the truth getting established,” he added.

“CBI has initiated an inquiry into the clearance given by the Forward Markets Commission to MCX to become a nationwide exchange, even though MCX was not fulfilling stipulated criteria,” said a CBI spokesperson.

The MCX spokesperson could not be reached for comment.

According to the second person mentioned earlier, a total of nine individuals and two firms—63 Moons and MCX—are under investigation. Apart from Shah, the other eight names include Joseph Massey, former deputy managing director of MCX, four former chairmen of FMC (one of them later joined Securities and Exchange Board of India), and three other FMC officials.

Calls made to Massey for a comment were not answered.

Mint is not naming the others as we could not reach out to them for a comment.

“Jignesh Shah and FTIL illegally retained shares beyond the permissible limit of 26%, thereby deriving wrongful gain of Rs137 crore by selling 26 lakh excess shares at Rs1,032 per share,” said the second person quoted earlier.

This is the third CBI case against FTIL and Shah. CBI has registered a chargesheet against the two in the Rs5,574.35 crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) scam for allegedly defrauding two public sector commodities trading firms—PEC Ltd and MMTC Ltd. CBI is also probing a case of alleged irregularities in according recognition to MCX-SX by capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in 2008 and further renewing the recognition in 2009 and 2010.

MCX, promoted by Shah, was to launch an IPO in 2009-10, but postponed it owing to the global financial meltdown. It finally went public in 2012.","MCX case: CBI raids FTIL’s Mumbai HQ, Jignesh Shah’s residence","['jignesh', 'residence', 'raids', 'commodity', 'exchange', 'recognition', 'cbi', 'case', 'mcx', 'shahs', 'hq', 'shah', 'ftils', 'ftil', 'mumbai', 'markets', 'search', 'permission']","MCX, promoted by FTIL chairman Jignesh Shah, was to launch an IPO in 2009-10 but it was postponed because of global financial meltdown.

It really helped to run into my friend, Shivani, who has been dealing with her own anxiety and depression for almost a year now. I spoke to her about our 12-year-old daughter and her struggle with social anxiety. It was a relief to meet someone who would validate what we were experiencing as a family. I told her what I had been doing to help Aliza.

“Don’t show her solutions. Don’t tell her how to think,” said Shivani. “She needs silence more than she needs words.”

I felt rebuffed. I was trying so hard. I was reading so much. I was tapping into every resource I could summon. I was ready to solve this with my daughter and our family.

“Slow down,” I heard Shivani say to me. “Don’t try to untangle knots that need time to unravel.”

It was a relief for all of us. We stopped trying to fix things superficially. Instead, we started living together more than we had been doing. We became less busy. We ate more. We walked together. We stayed silent together. We slept close to each other.

We had conversations.

“Should I show you a story written by a 12-year-old? It’s called, ‘From boredom to chocolate’.”

“Mamma, is it a success story?” Aliza asks. “Then I don’t want to read it.”

“No, it is about the writer’s struggle, but she gets better in the end. In that sense, it is a success story.”

“Ok, then I will read it,” she says. I had the good sense to not ask her later if she had indeed read it.

“Mamma, do you ever have the urge to hit yourself?” Aliza asks me one night as we sit on the bed together.

“Oh well, Mamma has been suicidal,” I thought to myself, but I don’t say that aloud.

She begins to hit herself, slapping the sides of her forehead a few times. I raise my voice and ask her to read instead.

Reading always heals her. She carries three books with her sometimes. An unread book in her bag is her armour. Sometimes she finishes a novel and comes to me, looking rosy-cheeked and flushed with happiness. Someone has triumphed over circumstances. Somewhere, something has come together and she is reassured.

With time, we build a bank of activities that restore our balance. They are good for all of us. We go for long walks. We buy chocolate and sample street food. We discover burgers, gol gappas and kathi rolls. Aliza always judges a new food joint by the font and colours on the shop signage.

“No, no, we can’t eat in a place that uses comic sans,” she says.

We scout for second-hand book stores wherever we go. One Sunday morning, Aliza and I travel by the Metro and buses and finally take a rickshaw to Daryaganj to immerse ourselves in Delhi’s Sunday book market. We return home with 20 books in our backpacks. We are rich.

I save a photograph from my Twitter feed to show to the children. It is a message on the door of a vehicle that says—“Do, Not Disturb All ready Disturb”.

We laugh so hard I have tears in my eyes. The broken grammar of the line adds to our mirth. Aliza’s sisters suggest we make a placard for her to use at family get-togethers. Anytime the questions and comments get too much for her, she can flash her message—“Do not disturb, I am already disturb”.

“Mamma, do you think the Holocaust will repeat in our lifetime?” she asks me abruptly one day. “My friend says this time Muslims will be targeted.”

I tell her about my fears when I was her age. We talk about Safdar Hashmi, the writer and theatre activist who had been attacked and killed while performing a street play titled Halla Bol. I had been distraught as a teenager, unable to process the violence and blatant injustice.

“But Safdar Hashmi didn’t die, you know,” I tell Aliza. “His ideas and actions continue to inspire us. He is remembered every year. People who worked with him have kept up the fight.”

“We had a poem by him in our Hindi textbook,” Aliza tells me. We go online and read Hashmi’s words again. Our faith is consoled.

On another day, we talk about Aliza as a baby. I need to remind myself of the healthiest, most self-contained version of our child. I tell her about her unrestrained laughter as an infant. How she turned away from my breast and demanded the milk bottle, because she was hungrier than I could imagine. She tells me about a scene from the film The Boss Baby. The bossy baby flicks away the parent’s hand from the bottle as he settles in his crib to drink in peace. The connection between the movie character and herself as a baby makes her happy.

“Separate the emotion from yourself so you can address it,” I have said to her a few times. One day she manages to do it. We are on the way to school after a long period of absence.

“Mamma, my bones are shaking,” she tells me in the car. “My internal organs are rattling. If I were a character in a book, the line would be—that morning she was shaking from inside but it wasn’t because of the cold.” She has managed to reach the place where she can separate herself from her body’s reaction to anxiety.

Slowly, our conversations expand. She talks about the pressure to dumb down to fit in with peers. We open up about the tyranny of hierarchies—between genders, between young and old, between those who hold positions of power and others. Sometimes we share self-doubts and our own missteps. Things that make us feel lonely and isolated.

We talk about rejecting status quo and our fear of change. We promise to give ourselves as much time as we need. We are in no hurry to reach a happy ending. The longest journey of all is also the shortest distance that can be possible. It is the return to the self, a reconciliation with me.

New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set to improve its tally in the Rajya Sabha, winning 28 of the 59 seats that went to polls this year.

Rajya Sabha election results declared Friday showed that the BJP won nine of the 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Karnataka, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

While 33 Rajya Sabha seats witnessed no election, 26 went to polls on Friday. Of the 33 elected unopposed, 16 were from the BJP, three from its allies and five from the Congress, among others.

The Rajya Sabha election results showed that incumbent regional parties in states such as West Bengal and Telangana continue to perform well.

The BJP’s performance ensures that its dominance as the largest party in the Upper House continues, though the NDA is still short of a majority.

The biggest loser from Uttar Pradesh is the Samajwadi Party (SP), which had six out of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats that went to polls. It retained only one seat, that of Jaya Bachchan.

The BJP won a historic mandate in the Uttar Pradesh elections last year—giving it an edge in the Rajya Sabha elections this year. The party’s gains come at the cost of the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP, which was voted out of power last year.

Union finance minister Arun Jaitley is among the BJP candidates who has entered the Upper House from Uttar Pradesh.

The counting of votes was delayed in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Karnataka following complaints by members from different political parties.

In Karnataka, the Congress won in three out of four seats, while the BJP’s tally got reduced to one seat. Overall, the Congress’ gain was on two seats in the state while the BJP lost out on one.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the BJP’s candidate from Karnataka for Rajya Sabha, polled the highest votes, with 50 legislators favouring his candidature. Congress candidates L. Hanumanthaiah, Syed Naseer Hussain and G.C. Chandrasekhar got elected. Seven Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, rebels were allowed to vote despite the party having asked the speaker to disqualify them from the voting process. The seven JDS legislators had defied the party whip in the 2016 Rajya Sabha elections and are all set to join the Congress party on Sunday.

In West Bengal, the chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) maintained its tally by retaining four seats. In the fifth, Congress’ Abhishek Manu Singhvi won. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, lost out on one seat that it held earlier.

The TMC’s Subhasis Chakraborty, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Nadimul Haque, and Santanu Sen won. Singhvi, who was backed by the TMC, received 47 votes. The CPM’s Rabin Deb, who was backed by other Left parties, lost.

In Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) won all three Rajya Sabha seats without any hitch. Its winning candidates were Banda Prakash, Lingaiah Yadav and Santosh Kumar. The Congress lost out on two seats which it held earlier.

In Jharkhand, the Congress managed to retain one seat it held earlier and the BJP gained one seat. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) lost out on the one seat it held before the Rajya Sabha elections.

The BJP maintained status quo in the one seat that went to polls in Chhattisgarh. The party’s national general secretary, Saroj Pandey, defeated the Congress’s Lekhram Sahu.

In Kerala, leader of Sharad Yadav-led Janata Dal (United) splinter faction, M.P. Veerendra Kumar, won with 89 votes. He was supported by the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which has 91 seats in the 140-member state assembly.

The lone seat had fallen vacant because of Kumar’s resignation from the Rajya Sabha in December, in protest against JD(U) chief and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar joining ranks with the NDA.

Six members of Kerala Congress (Mani) abstained from voting. The lone BJP member, O. Rajagopal, and independent member P.C. George also abstained. One member of the Indian Union Muslim League could not vote due to ill-health.

Mumbai: Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 plunged to five-month lows on Friday as jittery investors rushed to sell shares on heightened fears of a trade war after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese imports. The sharp sell-off in Indian markets was part of the global meltdown, as global risk aversion intensified.

During the day, both the Sensex and the Nifty shed over 1% of their value, while the latter dipped below the 10,000-mark. The Sensex closed at 32,596.54, down 409.73 points, or 1.24%, while the Nifty ended at 9,998.05, down 116.70 points, or 1.15%. The Indian benchmark indices have fallen over 10% from life highs touched on 29 January.

Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said the market slump seems to be a bit of an overreaction, coming at a time when year-end considerations were weighing on markets anyway. “Weak domestic factors, coupled with trade war fears, may further drag the markets if a recovery is not seen by Monday. If the markets break crucial support levels, it will lead to further selling and take the Nifty to 9,650,” he said.

Markets worldwide were under pressure, following weakness in the US markets. Markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea have slipped 2-4%, while European markets opened lower.

Trump has instructed US trade representative Robert Lighthizer to impose broader tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, as recompense for alleged intellectual property abuses. In response, China said it does not fear a trade war with the US and announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the US.

Sonal Varma, chief India economist and Aurodeep Nandi, India economist at Nomura, said that although marginal, India is also exposed to a slowing China and increased US trade protectionism; there is room for a policy response.

“The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been building forex reserves as a means of self-insurance from financial-stability risks and will use them to defend the rupee if needed. The monetary policy stance is neutral and rates can be hiked to rein in inflation expectations, but given balance-sheet concerns, we do not expect aggressive rate hikes,” they wrote in a report.

Sahil Kapoor, chief market strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research, said risks to global trade are real and tremors in the markets are just a reflection of that.

“The total size of global trade is about $20.8 trillion and all the participants benefit from it. The magnitude of tariffs imposed currently are small but could have other repercussions. Currently, we are still at an early stage to understand nuances of trade war, but if it happens, the global recovery may have to write its obituary faster than expected,” he added.

The sharp sell-off in markets follows an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee, meeting for the first time under new chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point.

Policymakers continued to project a total of three interest rate hikes this year. The central bank projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019, implying three rate hikes next year, compared with two 2019 moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December. Higher interest rates in the US generally lead to outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets considered to be riskier assets.

However, analysts do not see any impact on the foreign fund flow into India but are worried that the markets are likely to correct further due to both global and domestic factors. “We are looking for further correction till about 9,600 levels. Currently, Indian markets are trading at 17 times on one-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) basis. At 9,600 levels, we feel valuations will become attractive. We continue to be bullish from longer term perspective,” said Kapoor.

According to Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, the markets have to navigate both domestic and global headwinds now. “Besides trade war fears, US bond yields are also hardening, which may constrain RBI from cutting rates. This is going to cause turbulence, while political anxiety in India is going to add to volatility,” he said.

However, Bodke also added that India is at the cusp of revival in earnings, which is likely to comfort markets and debt resolution by some of the stressed firms are positive factors for the markets.

“The markets are close to fair valuations,” he added. Currently, the Sensex is trading at 17.40 times its expected earnings for the current fiscal, which makes it one of the most expensive gauges among peers.

So far this year, the Sensex and Nifty slipped 4-5%. FIIs have bought Indian shares worth $1,659.90 million, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have pumped in Rs19,689.53 crore so far in 2018.

46,Punit Goenka: The mark of Z,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/qDaZ1JBw7sW1tEbX8UCr1N/Punit-Goenka-The-mark-of-Z.html,"The managing director and chief executive officer of Zee Entertainment Enterprises on his triumphs, missteps, and the virtues of focusing on a single task","Punit Goenka remembers the exact moment he stopped seeing viewership numbers on Fridays.

In 2005, Zee launched a prime-time show called Saat Phere. It was an important series for them, and Goenka, then business head for Zee TV, was eager to know how it had done. He left office on Thursday night at around 9.30, assuming he would see the numbers on Friday morning, as he did normally. But an SMS he received congratulating him on the show was a rude surprise—he realized that the ratings actually came out on Thursday nights; it was just that his team would see them on Friday mornings.

“That’s when I called my entire team, and that was the first firing they got from me,” he says. He told them: “From now on, we’ll see the ratings on Thursday night, discuss them, plan what has to be done, and then I’ll take you out for drinks and dinner.”

I’m on the 16th floor of a Lower Parel high-rise, the Mumbai headquarters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (Zeel), part of the Essel Group, which has been run by Goenka’s family for over 90 years. Goenka, Zee’s 42-year-old managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), is sitting across from me on the other side of a large table, in his spacious office. We’re 6 hours into Goenka’s workday, the office end of which usually wraps up by around 7.30pm. After that, it’s “business over social activity”, meeting with colleagues or business interests over a drink, till 9pm. Then it’s home to the family: wife Shreyasi, an art patron and co-director of the Saat Saath Arts Foundation, and their daughter and two sons.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises is divided into six verticals: domestic broadcast, international broadcast, digital, movies, music and live events. In the days leading up to our meeting, though, it was the digital, or OTT (over the top), division, headed by younger brother Amit (also CEO, international broadcast business), which was on Goenka’s mind. A few days before I met Goenka, the network had launched Zee5, a part-free, part-subscription streaming platform which subsumed Zee’s earlier platforms, Ozee and

Ditto TV.

With a host of streaming options—Hotstar, Amazon Prime, ALTBalaji and Netflix are just a few—available to the Indian consumer, Zee5 has its work cut out. Goenka says they plan to release one new original series every month. Episodes of original series like The Story (Hindi) and Nanna Koochi (Telugu) are already available to stream; there’s also a series about drug trafficking by director Q, starring Naseeruddin Shah, in the pipeline. “I think maybe six months into the launch is the right time to take a call on whether original content (is working),” Goenka says, “once we have a critical mass of consumers”.

I ask if the content of the digital space might turn off some existing TV viewers of Zee who sign up. “What we cater to on TV is a slightly elder audience base,” Goenka says. “The TV audience will come to Zee5 to do catch-up if they’ve missed out on something.” Though he admits that the “ecosystem” of streaming TV is still being built in the country, he says he would be disappointed if OTT platforms didn’t contribute 10-12% of his total revenue numbers in the next three-five years.

Goenka grew up and studied in several towns and cities—Hisar in Haryana; Delhi; Sanawar in Himachal Pradesh; Mumbai—before being sent to Institut Le Rosey, a boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland. He wasn’t an avid sportsperson, but made it to the school rugby team (his weight worked to his advantage, he says). More importantly, he learnt how to ski, an activity which remains a passion even today. He was, he freely admits, an average student. Back in India, he dropped out after a year from the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics and started working.

“I was always clear from the beginning that I will be in the family business,” Goenka says. His father, Subhash Chandra, Rajya Sabha member and founder and chairman of Zee and the Essel Group, started Zee TV in 1992; it became the most popular TV channel in a newly liberalized India. But Goenka had to learn the ropes first, training within the Essel Group. His first assignment, in 1993, was selling amusement park packages for EsselWorld to schools in Virar, Mumbai. He was assistant to the head of Essel Packaging, the floor supervisor of a factory, and executive assistant to his father for six months. He was then sent to Zee Music Records—a business he soon shut down. “Zee would not do cash dealings,” he says. “Four years ago, we re-entered (the music business) and now we’re doing pretty well, because it’s all moved to digital.”

Goenka was put in charge of organizing funding for Agrani—a programme to launch the group’s own satellite. He helped launch Dish TV, working with his uncle, Jawahar Goel, for a year in Delhi, “living out of a suitcase”. He then came back to Mumbai and ran Zee Sports. In 2005, he was made business head of Zee TV; in time, he was running the content for the entire network. In 2008, he took over as CEO from Pradeep Guha.

The Hindi general entertainment channels (GEC) market in the 1990s and early 2000s was limited to a couple of big entities, which put a lot of pressure on new shows to succeed. When Goenka became content head, he realized they needed to diversify. “I still remember those days where Zee ratings used to fluctuate and the Zee stock price would fluctuate. It was that volatile. I decided to invest disproportionately in regional markets.”

He also created his own working style. His father and he, Goenka says, are “opposite”. “He’s a self-made entrepreneur. His urgency of doing things is different from mine.” Goenka remembers the early days, when he had to argue for time for his diversification efforts to come good. “(My father) can multitask like nobody else. But I bring in the focus on one thing, and get it right.”

One thing he got wrong was entering the movie business in 2008, once he took over as CEO of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (“It was my first big failure”). Within a year, they pulled out of Hindi film production, though they continued producing Marathi films. Over the last several years—coinciding with Marathi cinema’s rise as an art-house cinema leader—they have become unlikely tastemakers, producing critically lauded titles like Elizabeth Ekadashi (2014), Killa (2014) and Natsamrat (2016). In Sairat (2015), they achieved a rare double, a critical favourite and a smash hit.

Their slate for 2018 looks just as impressive: Ravi Jadhav’s Nude, and their first entry into international prestige cinema: Beyond The Clouds, by Iranian director Majid Majidi. They have also re-entered the Hindi movie arena, though they’re stepping more cautiously this time, trying to lead with script-driven, rather than star-centric, projects.

Goenka likes to remain involved with the details of what his network is putting on air or on the big screen. He still takes narrations for new shows or movies, and, whenever he finds time, he’ll watch an episode of a show currently airing and text the department head with feedback. He doesn’t get much time to watch for pleasure—mainly on flights or on the treadmill in the mornings. Game Of Thrones is too much of an investment, he says, but he unwinds with a comedy, anything from The Big Bang Theory to Friends. He avoids watching his Indian competitors. “When I do that, I end up confusing my core audience base with theirs. The Zee core audience base is middle India—the stories, the characters are far more real, they don’t live in palaces, they don’t wear chiffon saris.”

Goenka has a trip to Switzerland coming up, which he’s visibly excited about, because it will give him a chance to catch up on some skiing. “It’s a stress-buster for me,” he says. “It gives me time to think.” He had initially taken up skiing because it was the one sport he could do on his own. “You didn’t need a team. It would just be me, skiing alone.” Nowadays, he still skis alone when he travels abroad, though he says his daughter, 15, is approaching his skill level and joins him sometimes.-

The next goal is to make Zee a more broad-based entertainment conglomerate. “In the next three years, we will be the largest media company in emerging markets and the largest media company in India,” he told Business Today in January 2017. He says he’s looking “aggressively” at the live entertainment space. “We haven’t succeeded so far because it’s a highly unorganized and fragmented market,” he says. “Now that the film business is back on track and the Zee5 launch is done, I’ll look at the live business and shape that.”

During our conversation, Goenka—who quit smoking cigarettes five months ago—puffs on a nifty-looking electronic tobacco device called IQOS, which heats tobacco instead of burning it (maker Philip Morris claims it reduces the risk of tobacco-related diseases compared with cigarettes). He is trying to be healthier, watch his diet. He hasn’t taken up a sport apart from skiing, but he works out on the treadmill as often as he can. He took up weight training for a while, then stopped. “I don’t like drastic changes,” he explains. He talks about becoming hands-off when it comes to certain parts of the business, then checks himself. “Well, not entirely hands-off.”",Punit Goenka: The mark of Z,"['business', 'mark', 'series', 'zee', 'goenka', 'head', 'zee5', 'z', 'skiing', 'punit', 'entertainment', 'tv', 'team']","Punit Goenka remembers the exact moment he stopped seeing viewership numbers on Fridays.

The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well.

Reliance Jio’s relentless aggression isn’t limited to its pricing strategy; there is no end in sight to its capacity for investments in the telecom sector.

Based on recent data presented in the Lower House of Parliament, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate that Reliance Jio has a 62% share of the combined data capacity of the country’s big four mobile companies. In other words, its capacity is about 1.6 times the capacity of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd combined.

But according to an analyst at another institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio also carries about two times the data traffic these three companies manage between themselves.

As such, Reliance Jio too needs to augment capacity to support growth, which it indeed is busy doing. The company has told analysts it will increase the number of base stations to around 200,000 in the next few quarters, or by about 25% from current levels. The above-mentioned analyst says that channel checks with suppliers suggest the count will go up to as high as 250,000 eventually.

What all of this means is that incumbents need to step up investments to keep up pace.

“Even as we do not think incumbents need to match Jio on data capacity anytime soon, we do believe they need to accelerate their efforts in closing the gap. This may mean elevated levels of capex for the next two-three years, in our view, posing upside risks to capex forecasts,” Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients.

This comes at a time when cash flows are drying up. Idea generated next to nothing in terms of cash last quarter, and that was before a series of tariff cuts by Reliance Jio in January. Needless to say, the increasing gap between cash flow and capital expenditure needs to be funded through other means.

So it isn’t surprising that all operators are busy with asset sales, equity/bond issuances or a combination of both. Airtel has periodically sold stakes in its tower infrastructure company and is even considering listing its Africa business to generate funds. Idea has diluted equity, while Reliance Jio is raising over $2 billion (Rs13,000 crore) in debt to fund capital expenditure.

From the looks of it, the need for funds will remain high, given where analysts’ estimates are with respect to capex needs. The fact that some telecom firms are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst and their stocks are beaten down just rubs salt into their wounds.","Thanks to Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are squeezed from both ends","['vodafone', 'airtel', 'data', 'pricing', 'need', 'telecom', 'needs', 'reliance', 'jio', 'squeezed', 'idea', 'companies', 'analysts', 'capacity', 'thanks', 'ends']","Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/MintThe general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing.

48,Is universal basic income a feasible idea in India?,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/WwFH79xl9Ypyb8Qk7f4yiL/Is-universal-basic-income-a-feasible-idea-in-India.html,"While a true universal basic income seems unworkable at the current status of the Indian economy, certain dimensions of basic income policies may prove more promising","According to the Economic Survey 2017, an annual cash transfer of Rs7,620 to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts, distributed to 75% of the population, would push all but India’s absolute poorest above the 2011-12 Tendulkar poverty line and bring the national poverty rate down to 0.5%. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

Talk of a universal basic income is no longer limited to Silicon Valley moguls and Scandinavian social democrats. The idea is swiftly gaining currency among economists long frustrated by convoluted welfare bureaucracies and weak state capabilities. Universal basic income is an alluring alternative to traditional poverty alleviation programmes: would it not be easier to just hand out cash?

In India, a growing emphasis on Aadhaar-based direct benefit transfers, small basic income trials, and the search for alternatives to flagship welfare schemes have created a fertile environment for discussion about universal basic income. This debate was re-energized by the Economic Survey 2017, which included a full chapter on financing, targeting, and distributing an Indian universal basic income. The survey argued that by transferring benefits directly from state coffers into Aadhaar-linked bank accounts, universal basic income could sidestep the exclusion, misallocation, and leakage found in major welfare schemes.

According to its headline estimates, an annual transfer of Rs7,620, distributed to 75% of the population, would push all but India’s absolute poorest above the 2011-12 Tendulkar poverty line and bring the national poverty rate down to 0.5%. This would cost approximately 4.9% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), fiscal room for which could be found among major subsidies for the poor and those accruing to the well-off, as well as some of the largest Central government programmes. The survey advocated a quasi-universal transfer, citing political and fiscal prudence, and suggested methods ranging from affluence testing to self-targeting to exclude the top 25% of the income distribution.

The survey’s chapter deserves praise for explaining the internal logic behind the pursuit of a universal basic income and firmly embedding it within mainstream policy discourse. By articulating the rationale for such a policy and discussing the instruments at India’s disposal, constraints on policy design, and strategies for implementation, it provided a substantive blueprint around which to structure discussions of an Indian universal basic income. Aware of the tricky logistics of last-mile delivery and the thorny politics of carving out fiscal room, the survey prudently concluded that it was time for further discussion, not implementation.

However, should future Indian policymakers wish to implement a universal basic income, the Economic Survey 2017’s proposal alone offers a weak foundation. A close examination of the proposal’s core features and assumptions reveals the large gap between a universal basic income as it is typically understood and its real-world application. The proposed transfer considers neither the impact of the loss of consumption from removing existing welfare benefits, nor the costs of transitioning to a cash-based safety net. Combined with the use of the Tendulkar poverty line in its calculations, widely criticized for being too low, the sum seems hardly a basic income.

It is also not clear whether universal basic income can effectively outperform major social programmes. The empirical literature on the PDS (public distribution system) and MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) reveals that both schemes have improved significantly in terms of targeting performance, coverage, and impact on poverty reduction. Other national programmes seek to accomplish long-term development goals, few of which can be accomplished by cash transfers. This leaves scant space for a meaningful, budget-neutral basic income, while efforts to exclude the rich could reintroduce a role for targeting methods that carry high associated costs for administrators and citizens. Evaluations of direct benefits transfer pilots and Aadhaar implementation show that far from disintermediating a sclerotic administrative machinery, Aadhaar-linked payments throw the limits of the Indian state into sharp relief.

While there is much uncertainty about its final form, it is clear that the quest for universal basic income involves navigating the tricky waters of weak state capacity and the urgency of improving India’s existing welfare architecture. While a true universal basic income seems unworkable at India’s current level of development, certain dimensions of basic income policies may prove more promising.

Small unconditional cash transfers targeted at vulnerable groups have been used by governments from Pakistan to Zambia to successfully improve development outcomes, and can help plug gaps in the patchwork of current social security programmes. A cost-effective step in this direction is to scale up benefits and coverage for social pensions and maternity entitlements, which are backed by evidence of progressive targeting and low leakage levels. Relaxing eligibility criteria and moving towards universalization of existing schemes—the PDS, in particular, has benefited from this approach—presents an alternative path to a less paternalistic and more effective welfare state. The preconditions for such scale-up include rationalizing delivery mechanisms and fund-flows, mitigating delays, and building institutional strength.

Finally, if universal basic income’s allure still proves too powerful to resist, a basic income trial can generate much-needed evidence to effectively dismiss or champion the idea. Such a pilot should be administered by public agencies across several districts or states, evaluated by an independent entity, with robust ethical oversight and protections for participants. Since the core empirical question is whether the Indian government can efficiently deliver cash transfers at scale, this experiment could pay close attention to the impact of programme design and implementation (such as payment channels and transfer size), cost-effectiveness, and targeting performance, in addition to individual and community outcomes.

Until such data is available, the policy discourse must clearly distinguish between efforts to provide a genuinely universal, unconditional, and livable income, and interventions that may derive inspiration from a universal basic income but share little in the way of form or substance. Even so, if a universal basic income can impel a greater focus on universalistic principles in making social policy choices, and strengthening institutions of service delivery, then it may have proven its worth through discussion alone.

49,Elections 2019: What the political realignment in Uttar Pradesh means,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/IkDdFGUh5tZzZSeaUVWgzK/What-the-political-realignment-in-Uttar-Pradesh-means.html,"The SP-BSP alliance in UP Lok Sabha bypolls was driven by electoral compulsions, and may pose a formidable challenge to BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections","Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party’s Mayawati. How the Congress engages with the SP-BSP alliance could also have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) defeat in the recent UP Lok Sabha bypolls has been mainly attributed to the successful alliance between two erstwhile arch-rivals: the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The brute arithmetic in favour of the alliance proved to be unassailable for the BJP even in Gorakhpur, a seat held by the party since 1991, vacated recently by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The smooth sailing of the SP-BSP alliance in the UP bypolls and evident bonhomie among the leaders of the two parties after tasting victory have raised expectations of a similar front being put up against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Evidence from post-poll surveys conducted by the Lokniti research programme at the New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) suggests that the narrowing social base of both parties since 2014 has made it politically pragmatic for them to bury differences and come together. Our analysis also suggests that the combined electoral strength of the two parties will pose a formidable challenge for the BJP in the country’s largest state, which sends 80 Lok Sabha members to the 543-strong Lower House.

The decision of the SP and BSP to explore the possibility of an electoral alliance seems to be driven by the threat that the BJP poses to their respective electoral bases. As the chart illustrates, the BJP has been very effective in mobilizing social groups which were reluctant to vote for it prior to 2014. The party has managed to wean away non-Yadav OBC (other backward classes) voters from the SP and non-Jatav Dalit voters from the BSP.

The BJP’s ability to mobilize support among these social groups during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 UP elections sent alarm bells ringing in the state as it restricted the support base of the SP to Muslims and Yadavs, and that of the BSP to Jatav voters. The challenge is more acute for the BSP which has lost a section of its core support base—non-Jatav Dalits—to the BJP. It may be difficult for the BSP to arrest the decline in its support base unless the BJP’s juggernaut in Uttar Pradesh is halted.

At the moment, it seems that a grand alliance is the only effective strategy to consolidate anti-BJP votes, and to potentially damage the BJP’s prospects in the state. At the aggregate level, in both 2014 and 2017, the combined vote share of SP and BSP exceeded that of the BJP and its allies.

This is also true at the constituency-level, when we compare the seat-wise BJP vote share with the combined vote share of BSP and SP. Of the 73 Lok Sabha constituencies that the BJP and Apna Dal won in 2014, the vote share of the BJP alliance was higher than the combined vote-share of the SP-BSP in only about half of them (39 seats). More importantly, only in 22 of the 73 seats did the BJP have a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the SP-BSP alliance.

In the 2017 UP elections, the BJP alliance’s vote share was greater than the combined vote share of the Congress, SP and BSP in 116 of the 325 assembly constituencies won by the BJP and its partners.

The SP and BSP may have successfully tested waters in Gorakhpur and Phulpur but it remains to be seen if they actually decide to extend this cooperation to 2019 Lok Sabha elections. If they do so, the road ahead would not be entirely bereft of challenges. The top leadership will have to convince the local leadership and keep party workers enthused to campaign for their respective alliance partners. Negotiations on seat sharing are unlikely to be smooth. Also, anti-BJPism cannot be the only glue that holds the alliance together. Unless there is a broader synergy between the parties and their workers, the alliance may unravel. How the Congress engages with the SP-BSP alliance could also have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

All eyes will be on these dynamics over the next few months as Uttar Pradesh is known to determine national fortunes.

50,Hong Kong can be India’s gateway to China: Gautam Bambawale,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/IiMAWzG8C7MRi85S9OSoUO/Hong-Kong-can-be-Indias-gateway-to-China-Gautam-Bambawale.html,"Double taxation avoidance pact will stimulate greater flow of investment, personnel between Hong Kong and India, says Indian ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale","India’s ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale, says India and China have been working closely together on reducing non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals and information technology sectors.

Hong Kong: India and Hong Kong signed a double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) on Monday, 29 March, with an aim to improve transparency in tax matters and to aid in curbing tax evasion and avoidance.

The agreement was signed by the Indian ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale, and Hong Kong finance secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in Hong Kong.

“The DTAA agreement will stimulate a greater flow of investment, technology and personnel from India to Hong Kong, and vice versa,” Bambawale said at a joint event organized by the Asia Society Hong Kong and the Indian Embassy.

India has more than 86 DTAAs in place with various countries that provide tax relief on transactions carried out between India and these countries.

The India-Hong Kong DTAA offers similar provisions as it will give protection against double taxation to over 1,500 Indian companies and businesses that have a presence in Hong Kong as well as to Hong Kong-based companies providing services in India.

It will also provide clarity to international businesses operating in both countries regarding tax rates and tax jurisdictions, as they will now be taxed in only one of the signatory countries. This should allow investors to be more confident about their investment decisions.

Recent years have seen trade and investment relations between India and Hong Kong expand rapidly.

India was Hong Kong’s third largest export market (after China and the US) in 2017 and Hong Kong was India’s third largest export market (after the US and the UAE).

India-Hong Kong trade in 2017 was approximately $34 billion (a growth of 27% over the previous year) while exports from India to Hong Kong were close to $13.7 billion, an increase of 15.8%. India’s imports from Hong Kong also increased by 35.9% to $20.34 billion.

Hong Kong companies have also been increasingly looking at India as an investment destination and many of them have a huge presence in India, including China Light and Power (CLP), Li and Fung, Jardines, Shangri La, Kerry Logistics and Johnson Electric.

Hong Kong is similarly host to a large number of Indian companies and professionals in banking, IT and shipping.

Eleven public sector banks and three private sector banks from India are currently operating in Hong Kong. It is also a major sourcing centre for Indian companies. Hong Kong has emerged as a major re-exporter of items it imports from India to Mainland China.

“Hong Kong has a very well established Indian diaspora and has much wealth and business influence within the territory. With DTAA, businesses in both India and Hong Kong have finally been given better financial incentives to work together and increase trade and prosperity between them,” said Bambawale, who has previously been the high commissioner of India to Pakistan and ambassador of India to Bhutan.

He was also the first consul general of India in Guangzhou and served in Hong Kong and Beijing between 1985 and 1991.

The double taxation avoidance agreement comes as a step in the right direction at a time when India-China relations have been severely tested with military tension escalations close to their disputed border in Doklam, increasing competition in their neighbourhood of South Asia, and with growing mistrust between Beijing and New Delhi.

But Bambawale remains optimistic and pragmatic.

“The damage 2017, and Doklam have inflicted on the relationship between the two Asian giants is by no means irreparable,” he says. “Due to the sage leadership of both countries and hard work of our diplomats, the issue of Doklam has been de-escalated peacefully.”

He explains that while a complete de-escalation may take months or even a decade, both countries plan to look past it to forge greater economic and cultural bilateral engagements. “Today, India-China trade has reached an all-time high of $84.5 billion. This is not counting the $34 billion, which India trades with Hong Kong. We are aiming for $100 billion dollars of trade in the near future,” he said

Bambawale points to a key success story emblematic of this growth: “In the space of just a couple of years, the Chinese maker of budget mobile phones Xiaomi became the largest mobile handset provider in Indian market, overtaking Samsung. Today, India is seen as one of the most important overseas smartphone markets for Chinese brands, which face stiff competition and a saturated market at home. Chinese companies, including Xiaomi and Oppo, have even set up manufacturing plants in India. Chinese companies today account for more than 50% of the India mobile handset market.”

In 2017, Chinese companies also invested roughly $311 million in India, and Indian companies invested close to $150 million in China, indicating an upward growth trajectory in the investment relationship between the two nations.

“The fact that Alibaba is a major part of Paytm in India is a very big deal, and we think that Indian companies would also be in a position in the near future to help out in some of the areas that the Chinese government has targeted, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data,” he said.

Citing another success story of China-India relations from a cultural standpoint, Bambawale said: “Indian Bollywood movie Dangal became the most popular non-Chinese films in China. This is unique. And we should build on this trend. China should import more Bollywood films so as to better understand India.”

“India and China are partners in development and progress and not rivals,” he says.

However, he concedes that both countries are “not interacting enough, trading enough, travelling enough.”

He believes that this is where Hong Kong can play a critical role.

Pointing to the strong growth in relationship in recent years between India and the Association of Southeast Nations (Asean), which he attributes to the leadership role provided by Singapore, he says: “Hong Kong can play a similar role as Singapore of being a leading catalyst in deepening ties between India and China, because there is greater trust and understanding between India and Hong Kong today than between India and China.”

“If Hong Kong is able to play this catalyst role, I think the Indian elephant and the Chinese dragon will dance together sooner, rather than later.”

But he is realistic that there is a lot of catching up to do still.

Citing one such example, he notes that every week between Singapore and different cities of India, there are over 500 flights.

The corresponding figure for Hong Kong is just about a 100.

Bambawale is convinced though that this issue of connectivity will be addressed in the near future with deepening economic ties.

“The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement will be a great step forward in integrating India better with Hong Kong, and India with China as a whole,” he says.

Edited excerpts from an interview:

What critical challenges do India and China face today economically?

The foremost is India’s large and growing trade deficit with China. Last year, it was $51 billion, which accounts for half of India’s global trade deficit, of about $110 billion, with all the rest of the countries globally.

The increasing trade deficit with China can be attributed primarily to the fact that Chinese exports to India are predominantly in manufactured items to meet the demand of fast expanding sectors such as telecom and power, while India’s exports to China are characterized by primary and intermediate products. We are also talking with the Chinese government to work on another long-standing issue. India sells its pharmaceuticals and computer software or information technology-enabled services (ITeS) globally, but we don’t sell much at all in China. And the reason for this is the non-tariff barriers against these two industries in which India has a competitive advantage.

We are trying to work with the Chinese government to reduce these non-tariff barriers and then we hope that we will be able to reduce our trade deficit.

What is your view of India’s decision to boycott the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China last year, which the US and Japan attended?

We don’t have a problem with the overall BRI, but one of its flagship projects, which is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

We have a major problem on that because we believe that it violates our sovereignty and territorial integrity.

It runs through a part of land that we claim to be India’s, so we oppose it. So, unfortunately, that is an area of strategic disagreement. But, we need to cooperate more with each other to move forward and past it.

How can India and China better cooperate in the near future to ensure a de-escalation in geopolitical tensions?

Today, the energies of the people of India are focused inward on economic development, social progress and national transformation. In initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Clean India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Smart Cities’, we welcome China’s participation and help in furthering these national goals of India. I feel that for two large countries with big populations, big economies, we are not talking to each other enough, and we need to do that much more.

We need to do it at the leadership level of President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but we also need to most importantly increase the exchanges at the people-to-people level.

In 2018, we should aim to have a greater exchange of military personnel, parliamentarians, business leaders, journalists, academics, students, sportspersons and filmmakers between the two nations.

Yet, another way is to increase tourism between the two nations in both directions.

What are the common positions of India and China today that can be leveraged to improve relations between the two nations?

Internationally, India and China are partners in the G20, in the WTO, in BRICS, in SCO, in which on many international issues we have very similar approaches, if not identical, positions and stands. The prime example of a common position is that of climate change. We have been working closely together on this in the past and under the new international circumstances arising from the West, it is especially important that we continue to work even closer together.

India and China have also benefited tremendously from globalization. It has provided a common platform for both our countries to benefit economically and grow on the world stage. We need to together ensure that the global rules of trade and security between nation-states should continue to be upheld and promoted.

Finally, India and China are threatened by international terrorism. We need to greatly expand our cooperation in counter-terrorism to make the world a safer place.",Hong Kong can be India’s gateway to China: Gautam Bambawale,"['indias', 'hong', 'indian', 'india', 'gateway', 'bambawale', 'gautam', 'kong', 'chinese', 'china', 'companies', 'trade', 'countries']","India’s ambassador to China, Gautam Bambawale, says India and China have been working closely together on reducing non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals and information technology sectors.

51,Jerome Powell moves to normalize US monetary policy,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/YMRg9zJSXMK9yvRyeiOLEO/Jerome-Powell-moves-to-normalize-US-monetary-policy.html,The strengthening economic outlook for the US economy augurs well for the global economy,"Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint

All eyes were on Jerome Powell this week as he chaired the federal open market committee (FOMC) meeting for the first time since taking charge of the US Federal Reserve. How different will he be from his immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke? And how will his monetary policy complement the fiscal expansion by the Donald Trump administration? Both these issues have profound implications for the global economy.

As expected, the committee that sets US policy interest rates increased them by 25 basis points. Apart from the policy action, financial markets all over the world were looking for the accompanying commentary and future projections of key economic indicators. It will also be interesting to see how the Fed’s communication evolves under Powell. He gave brief and direct answers in his first press meet while indicating that he would hold more press conferences. This should help improve the market’s understanding of the Fed’s position as it moves forward on the path of normalization.

Meanwhile, the projections released by the rate-setting committee showed that it expects a total of three rate hikes this year. However, the number of participants who expect four rate hikes has gone up compared to the December meeting. The committee also expects rates to go up at a faster pace next year compared to its December projections. While the FOMC raised its projection for economic growth and expects the unemployment rate to come down further, it kept its inflation projection unchanged for the current year and next year. However, it revised its core inflation projection, mildly overshooting the target of 2% in 2019.

The Fed expects the US economy to grow at 2.7% in the current year and 2.4% in 2019. The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 3.6% in 2019. Powell explained that while the unemployment rate has come down from the highs of the 2008 recession, inflation has not gone up, indicating that the relationship between inflation and unemployment—as captured by the Phillips curve—has weakened. As things stand today, this would mean that interest rates in the US will not go to the level seen before the financial crisis in the foreseeable future. The median projection for the federal funds rate in 2020 stands at 3.4%, compared to the high of 5.25% seen in 2006.

Nevertheless, there are at least three broad takeaways for the global financial market and policymakers from Powell’s first FOMC meeting as Fed chair.

First, the strengthening economic outlook for the US economy augurs well for the global economy. Continued recovery in the global economy will also help other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, to gradually unwind their crisis-era policies and move towards normalcy. The strength of the US and global economy will also support the ongoing recovery in the Indian economy.

Second, although the Fed expects to gradually raise rates, global financial markets may still find higher rates difficult to handle. For instance, the three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is at its highest level since 2008. Trillions of dollars worth of debt and interest rate derivatives are anchored to Libor. Higher rates could affect confidence and lead to higher volatility in financial markets.

Higher interest rates could also make debt servicing more difficult for a large number of leveraged firms across the world. Analysing a global sample of 13,000 companies, S&P Global Ratings recently found that the proportion of highly leveraged entities was 37% in 2017 compared to 32% in 2007. Also, the non-financial corporate debt has gone up by 15 percentage points, globally, to 96% of the gross domestic product between 2011 and 2017 (goo.gl/ba2P35). These companies will be in greater difficulty if the Fed raises rates at a faster pace. Although inflation has remained subdued in recent years, the possibility of a pickup in prices on the back of fiscal stimulus and lower unemployment cannot be completely ruled out. Higher rates could also lead to portfolio rebalancing by international investors. Foreign investors, for example, have sold bonds worth over $2 billion in Indian markets over the last one month.

Third, while the risk of tightening financial conditions is roughly balanced at this stage, the global economy is facing a bigger threat from rising protectionism. In his remarks, Powell also noted that a number of FOMC members reported that businesses are concerned by the change in US trade policy. More protectionist measures by the Trump administration could lead to retaliation by trading partners, which will inevitably affect medium- to long-term prospects for global trade and growth.

Ten years after the financial crisis, even as the Fed is carefully moving towards normalizing policy—though it may have to move faster if inflation surprises on the upside—the risk for the global economy at the moment is populist measures by the US government.

Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to stop the misuse of user data on its site to manipulate voters in India, Brazil and the US.

In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg apologized for mistakes his company made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users, and promised to take tougher steps to restrict developers’ access to such information. The company, Zuckerberg said, “made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it”.

53,Gender-lens investing for financial growth,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/YFzLgjEM4Rn3NGqbiHng0J/Genderlens-investing-for-financial-growth.html,The global shakedown has led to considerations of the potential cost of not integrating gender into investment decision making,"Women have an exponentially harder time accessing capital than men.

The use of finance as a strong tool for social change is not a new practice—the success of the microfinance movement and the growth of female entrepreneurs have contributed to stronger economic growth for India.

Using gender as a category of analysis in investment decision making is an emerging area of interest. Gender-smart investing for public equities grew to $560 million (around Rs36,433 crore) in 2016 globally (Carlile and Pyott, 2016), with growth in emerging markets expected to accelerate to 4.6% in 2018. The market for integrating gender into the investment selection process is growing both in size and sophistication—currently we have 58 funds that total almost $2 billion in targeted fund size. Gender lens investing is a broad umbrella term which typically covers one or more of the following activities:

1. Investing in gender-based impact themes such as increasing access to capital for women entrepreneurs, supporting businesses that generate value by selling products and services that benefit women and girls: Women have an exponentially harder time accessing capital compared to men—women own only one-third of the small and medium enterprises in emerging markets. In India itself, we have a $158 billion financing gap for women-owned micro, small and medium enterprises (Micro, small and medium enterprise finance, improving access to finance for women-owned businesses in India, 2014).

2. Screening portfolio companies based on gender diversity in leadership and the workforce: Several studies highlight the direct link between female leadership and better business performance—for example, a 2015 MSCI World Index study showed that companies with strong female leadership generated a return on equity of 10.1% per annum versus 7.4% for those without. Yet, only three out of every 100 CEOs in India are women and only 9% of start-up founders are women.

3. Advancing gender diversity via fund manager selection whereby women are represented in investment decision-making roles: Women make up less than 10% of the venture capital and private equity workforce globally. Only 7% of partners at top 100 venture firms are women (Crunchbase Women in Venture report, 2016)—this number is even lower (4%) for India.

4. Integrating gender into the financial analysis of investments from a risk perspective: The global shakedown in Silicon Valley has led to considerations of the potential cost of not integrating gender into investment decision making—crucial for an industry whose core is risk-assessment and appetite.

With such a clear business case, what will it take for gender lens investing to move into the mainstream, so that financial return is balanced—indeed strengthened—with the inclusion mandate? Moving intentional capital—in any of the areas outlined above—is key for us to establish the investment thesis. Unless we make the investments, we will not have the data required to demonstrate that it may not be necessary to take a financial haircut to do gender lens investing. The best business case is the one that demonstrates financial success to our limited partners, that frames this as opportunity rather than experiment.

We also need to expand the pool and pipeline of female entrepreneurs and investors. Leveraging networks—such as WeConnect (a global network connecting women-owned businesses to qualified buyers) and SheEOs (which finances female entrepreneurs) enables women to pool together their capital, their networks and their ideas. There is a strong demand and need for good data and training. The evidence base on the financial and social impact of investments in closing the gender gap is very limited. There are some exceptions—e.g. Project Sage, which is a global scan of private equity, venture capital and private debt funds with a gender lens. But we need more regional and country-specific analyses coupled with training and tools for fund managers to explore new deal structures and highlight opportunities.

We also need more examples and more success stories to be shared and amplified. In India, where 400 million people remain cut off from the electricity grid, a market was built for off-grid solar products by focusing on women as distributors under the Lighting Asia/India programme. For distribution, Lighting Asia/India partnered with Frontier Markets, a clean-energy-products company, to develop a network of self-employed women recruited from self-help groups. These women-run alliances provide access to funds and technical assistance to help women in local villages start their own businesses. Between 2016 and 2020, the network is expected to expand to 20,000 women distributors from just 250 in 2016, highlighting the collective power of a community of women who function as both customers and distributors.

Whether it is a large private equity investment in a chain of maternal health clinics, or an early-stage investment in a new range of gender-neutral toys that subvert gender stereotypes, the venture capital private equity (VCPE) industry is increasingly seeing the value in applying a gender lens to investments.

At a recent VCPE conclave, a leading private equity global partner shared, “every company in the world is thinking about gender, so why should the VCPE firms not think about it.” The interest in gender lens investing is growing—and so is the opportunity for us to work towards valuing, rather than counting, women.

New York: Meredith Corp., which bought Time Inc. and its stable of magazines in January, plans to sell the flagship publication Time Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and the Money brand after completing a review of the $1.8 billion deal.

The company also plans to eliminate about 1,000 jobs over the next 10 months as it integrates other Time Magazine publications into a lineup that includes Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle, according to a statement Wednesday. The cuts are on top of firing notices given to 200 employees, the company said.

Meredith, based in Des Moines, Iowa, is looking for $400 million to $500 million in savings over the next two years as it tries to boost the profitability of the acquired publications in print and online. The sale isn’t a complete surprise: those titles were left out of an earlier proposal by Meredith.

“That was the plan all along I think,” said Craig Huber, an analyst who follows Meredith at Huber Research Partners. “Meredith has never liked the weekly magazine business because the editorial content gets stale very quickly.”

Huber said Newsweek and US News & World Report were each sold for $10 million or less, and he expects Meredith won’t get much more for the titles it just put up for sale “unless some rich family wants to own them for vanity reasons.” Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, owns Businessweek and competes with Fortune in providing business news and information.

The deal for Time gave Meredith a larger audience to compete for advertisers that are consolidating their spending with bigger media companies, as well as Facebook and Google. It also provided the billionaire Koch brothers, who agreed to support Meredith’s offer with an equity injection of $650 million, a stake in well-known media brands.

Odd Fit

But Fortune, Sports Illustrated and the other Time Magazine titles were an odd fit for Meredith, whose magazines mostly focus on entertainment, food, lifestyle, home, parenting, beauty and fashion.

Meredith chief executive officer Tom Harty said the magazines being sold have different target audiences and advertising bases, and that “each brand is better suited for success with a new owner.” The company estimates it reaches about 80% of US millennial women.

“We are pleased with the inbound interest we have received,” Harty said in the statement. “We are confident these brands will be positioned for growth with an owner that shares Meredith’s respect for editorial integrity and independence.”

Meredith is keeping People, the most profitable of the former Time titles. At year end, Meredith employed about 3,500 people full time.

New Delhi: A parliamentary panel has recommended including modules on Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) treatments in MBBS courses and vice versa, in a bid to reconcile allopathic and alternative systems of medicines and generate faith in AYUSH treatments.

The standing committee on health and family welfare said practitioners of modern medicine systems do not have much faith in AYUSH and often question their credibility and scientific validation. This is despite India being knowledge repository of traditional medicine since ages, it said.

“The committee, accordingly, recommends to the ministry to take concrete steps in introducing modules of modern system of medicine in the curriculum and pursue the ministry of health and family welfare for introducing similar modules of AYUSH systems of medicines in their MBBS course,” the committee report tabled in Parliament last week said.

An integrated approach will help understand the strengths of each system of medicine and increase the credibility of AYUSH, the report said.

“The need of the hour is to streamline the AYUSH systems of medicine by standardization and quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy drugs and improving the quality of education and healthcare services through AYUSH,” it said.

“At the same time, the curricula of both modern systems of medicine and AYUSH system need to be changed in such a way to strive for integration in the study of medical education itself followed by cross system referrals and integrated healthcare services,” it said.

Mixing courses of different systems of medicine is not rational, commented Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis-C-DOC Centre for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. “However, Ayush doctors can have short stints in hospitals to know various types of patients. An MBBS aspirant should only stick to science-based medicine course as previously,” said Misra. Previously too, in several articles published in Lancet in 2016, Misra had expressed doubts over the efficacy of Ayurvedic drugs claimed to treat diabetes.

Recently, health ministry has started co-locating AYUSH facilities at public health centres, community health centres and district hospitals. The committee also noted that AYUSH doctors are also participating in the National Health Programme and public health outreach activities and research activities undertaken to facilitate integration of Ayurveda and allopathic systems of medicine.

According to a study by the Delhi University’s Institute of Economic Growth published in PLOS One journal in 2017, only 6.9% of all patients who sought outpatient care used AYUSH, 3.5% used Indian systems of medicine such as Unani and Siddha, and 3% used homoeopathy. The study was based on a nationally representative health survey 2014 with the total sample size of 65,932 households (36,480 rural and 29,452 urban) comprising of 333,104 individuals (189,573 rural and 143,531 urban).

“This is consistent with the fact that use of allopathy treatment is more common and that there is hardly any differentials in use pattern across rural and urban India. Also, allopathy care accounted for over 90% of outpatient care across key socioeconomic and demographic variables,” the study said. “Overall, AYUSH utilization in India (about 7% of outpatient care) appears to be on the lower side when compared to some of the previous estimates or general perceptions,” it further said.

The study found that the use of AYUSH among middle-income households was lower when compared with poorer and richer households. AYUSH care utilization was higher among patients with chronic diseases and also for treating skin-related and musculo-skeletal ailments, the study observed.",AYUSH modules should be made part of MBBS courses: parliamentary panel,"['courses', 'health', 'panel', 'committee', 'parliamentary', 'care', 'system', 'systems', 'modern', 'welfare', 'ayush', 'modules', 'study', 'mbbs', 'medicine']","The parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare pointed out that it is often seen that practitioners of modern system of medicine do not have much faith in AYUSH system.

Mumbai:As many as 500 Air India pilots are awaiting government’s nod for the common pay structure recommended by the Dharmadhikari committee in 2012, nearly six months after the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) consented to it.

According to people familiar with the development, the IPG gave consent to the common pay structure in October 2017, following which the proposal was sent to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its approval, which is still “awaited”.

The Dharmadhikari panel had submitted its report to the government way back in January 2012, calling for common pay and allowances as per the norms for other public sector enterprises.

The IPG represents the Boeing wide-body fleet at the flag carrier. It agreed to accept the common pay structure for pilots in line with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines.

Under the common pay structure, flying allowance will be paid only in rupees and not in dollars, the IPG had said. Besides, pilots’ flying allowance hours will be reduced to 70 hours per month from 80 earlier.

However, they will be entitled to higher over-time fees. When contacted, an Air India spokesperson declined to comment, saying it is an internal policy issue. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), which represents the Airbus fleet pilots at the state-owned carrier, has long ago accepted the recommendations.

Meanwhile, Air India has decided to promote some 100 pilots to the executive rank as part of the level-mapping exercise, sources said.

“At the time of merger, a section of Air India narrow-body (erstwhile Indian Airlines) pilots got promoted. On the other hand, a section of wide-body (Air India) pilots had not got any promotion since 2007, resulting in anomalies,” they said.

The promotion of 100-odd pilots is aimed at removing such discrepancies, sources said. Once the agreement is in place, the pilots in Air India will have a uniform salary structure for both the Airbus and Boeing fleets, as per the sources.

Following the decision to merge the two airlines in 2007, various processes were to be integrated within 18-24 months, including HR. To arrive at common structure, the ministry constituted a committee of external experts under Justice Dharmadhikari.

The panel submitted its report in January 2012, which was further examined by a three-member inter-ministerial committee to suggest a time frame for implementation.

The inter-ministerial panel submitted its report in May 2012, and subsequently an implementation-cum-anomaly rectification committee was set up to implement the recommendations of the panel.",Air India pilots still waiting for govt nod for common pay structure,"['hours', 'govt', 'structure', 'flying', 'panel', 'india', 'pay', 'common', 'ipg', 'waiting', 'nod', 'air', 'pilots']","Air India pilots deboarding from an aircraft in New Delhi.

New Delhi: IndiGo and SpiceJet on Sunday shifted partial operations to Terminal 2 (T2) of the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the national capital, with both the airline reporting an on time departure of the flights and smooth operations.

IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, said 18 flights took off from the terminal in less than 12 hours and it worked in tandem with the Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), the airport operator, to ensure a seamless transition. Passengers were made aware of the move, it added.

“On day one, all our departures left either on time or before time without any No Shows. This has been possible because of the tremendous efforts that have been put in by my hundreds of team members in a very short period of time,” IndiGo president and whole-time director Aditya Ghosh said in a statement.

Similarly, a SpiceJet spokesperson said: “The operations and departure of its flights went smoothly without any delays and glitches and there was excellent and coordinated team work by SpiceJet ground staff. Eight flights have departed from T2 till now.”

Operations at the terminal kicked off 12am onwards on Sunday. IndiGo will be operating over 100 flights to T2 while SpiceJet will have 22 flights operating out of T2. The walking time between T2 and T3 will be five minutes.

After much dilly-dallying and court battles, IndiGo had on 15 March announced to relocate a chunk of its operations to the revamped T2 from 25 March. A day earlier, budget carrier SpiceJet too had announced to move 22 of its flights to seven destinations from T2. GoAir had moved its entire operations to T2 in October last year.

Complying with the recent order of the Supreme Court, both IndiGo and SpiceJet had submitted lists of sectors to GMR-led DIAL for shifting to T2 and DIAL had given its consent to the proposal. In its statement today, IndiGo said it kept its passengers informed well in advance via messages, emails and calls about the shifting of their flights to T2.

Besides, an extensive media campaign was launched for dissemination of the information. Extensive road signages have been put up by IndiGo over and above those provided by the airport operator. Free shuttle services at 10 minutes interval will also be made available between T1 and T2, DIAL said in a separate statement.

IndiGo staff were stationed in bright yellow T-shirts both at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 of the airport to address and assist passengers in need. Senior leaders of the airline were also present throughout the night to oversee operations.

T2, spread over 36,000 square meter, has been provided with 74 check-in counters, 18 self-check-in kiosks, 12 X-ray machines and six baggage reclaim belts. It has 16 boarding gates, including aero-bridges.","IndiGo, SpiceJet report smooth transition to T2 of Delhi airport","['operating', 'transition', 'spicejet', 'dial', 'terminal', 'operations', 'passengers', 'delhi', 'smooth', 't2', 'airport', 'flights', 'report', 'indigo']","IndiGo will be operating over 100 flights to T2 while SpiceJet will have 22 flights operating out of T2.

Mumbai/New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday conducted searches at the Mumbai headquarters of Financial Technologies of India Ltd (FTIL), and the residences of Jignesh Shah (former chairman of FTIL), as well as those of former chairmen of the erstwhile Forward Markets Commission (FMC)—in connection with alleged irregularities in granting recognition to the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as a national commodity exchange, said two people aware of the development.

In an emailed response, FTIL, now known as 63 Moons Technologies Ltd, said the search was in connection with the matter of permission granted to MCX in 2003, and added it has full faith in the judiciary. “We find this surprising as the permission was granted 15 years ago when the country did not have a pan-India commodity exchange. The permission to set up a nationwide commodity exchange was not only granted to MCX but also three others—NCDEX, NMCE and N-BOT,” said a spokesperson for 63 Moons.

“We have already been forced to exit MCX in 2014 and all documents related to the permission are obviously with MCX. Despite this, the search is being conducted on us and our chairman emeritus (Jignesh Shah),” he said.

“During the search at Shah’s residence on Friday, CBI did not find any single incriminating material and/or document. The agency is being misled by vested interests trying to divert attention from the truth getting established,” he added.

“CBI has initiated an inquiry into the clearance given by the Forward Markets Commission to MCX to become a nationwide exchange, even though MCX was not fulfilling stipulated criteria,” said a CBI spokesperson.

The MCX spokesperson could not be reached for comment.

According to the second person mentioned earlier, a total of nine individuals and two firms—63 Moons and MCX—are under investigation. Apart from Shah, the other eight names include Joseph Massey, former deputy managing director of MCX, four former chairmen of FMC (one of them later joined Securities and Exchange Board of India), and three other FMC officials.

Calls made to Massey for a comment were not answered.

Mint is not naming the others as we could not reach out to them for a comment.

“Jignesh Shah and FTIL illegally retained shares beyond the permissible limit of 26%, thereby deriving wrongful gain of Rs137 crore by selling 26 lakh excess shares at Rs1,032 per share,” said the second person quoted earlier.

This is the third CBI case against FTIL and Shah. CBI has registered a chargesheet against the two in the Rs5,574.35 crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) scam for allegedly defrauding two public sector commodities trading firms—PEC Ltd and MMTC Ltd. CBI is also probing a case of alleged irregularities in according recognition to MCX-SX by capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in 2008 and further renewing the recognition in 2009 and 2010.

MCX, promoted by Shah, was to launch an IPO in 2009-10, but postponed it owing to the global financial meltdown. It finally went public in 2012.","MCX case: CBI raids FTIL’s Mumbai HQ, Jignesh Shah’s residence","['jignesh', 'residence', 'raids', 'commodity', 'exchange', 'recognition', 'cbi', 'case', 'mcx', 'shahs', 'hq', 'shah', 'ftils', 'ftil', 'mumbai', 'markets', 'search', 'permission']","MCX, promoted by FTIL chairman Jignesh Shah, was to launch an IPO in 2009-10 but it was postponed because of global financial meltdown.

New Delhi: E-commerce platform ShopClues on Sunday said its revenues have grown by 60% this fiscal, while losses have been trimmed by almost 40% compared to the previous year as it focusses on growing business from categories like fashion and strengthening position in tier III cities and beyond.

The Gurgaon-based company, which competes with the likes of Flipkart and Amazon, is also confident of hitting profits in the next 12-18 months. Speaking to PTI, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Sanjay Sethi said the 2017 was spent ensuring that the company has the “right revenue margins” without any discounting or heavy spending on warehousing adding to its costs.

“2018 will be about continuing the growth. We became unit economic positive across all categories last year and we are looking at hitting profits in the coming fiscal,” he said. Sethi declined to comment on topline and bottomline numbers as these numbers are still being audited, Sethi said revenues have grown about 60%, while losses have come down by about 40%.

According to documents filed by the company with the corporate affairs ministry, ShopClues’ revenue from operations was at Rs180.3 crore in 2016-17, against Rs161.4 crore in the preceding fiscal. Its losses were also lower at Rs332.65 crore for the year ended March 2017 compared to a loss of Rs383.05 crore in 2015-16.

“We are like the ‘bazaar’. Our customers are cost-conscious. They are definitely ambitious and want the big brands but a significant part of their purchases is still done through places like local markets,” Sethi explained.

He added that about 80 % of the company’s orders come from tier III cities and beyond from places like Haflong, Palai, Chatrapur etc and that these customers are also buying more frequently—20% more as compared to those in metros.

Asked about competition against heavyweights like Flipkart and Amazon, ShopClues co-founder and chief business officer Radhika Ghai said there is enough room in the market for multiple players to grow. “Everyone thought shopping malls will kill big markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi. But that hasn’t happened. People throng both of these locations and are buying. Same is the case with us and our competitors,” she said.

Ghai added that the company has till date raised about $200 million and on track to hit profits, which shows that its “business model is working well”. She pointed that the e-commerce market in India is underpenetrated at about 2% of the multi-billion dollar retail industry in India and there is room for all the players to grow their business.","ShopClues sees 60% revenue growth, eyes profits in 12-18 months","['1218', 'eyes', 'company', 'business', 'profits', 'shopclues', '60', 'grown', 'fiscal', 'sees', 'revenue', 'crore', 'months', 'losses', 'sethi', 'revenues', 'growth']","A file photo of ShopClues CEO Sanjay Sethi who says revenues have grown by about 60% while losses have come down by about 40%.

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday ordered the attachment of all moveable property disclosed in an affidavit by former Ranbaxy Laboratories promoters, brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh, and others in relation to a Rs3,500 crore arbitration case with Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd.

The court was hearing Daiichi Sankyo’s plea, seeking execution of a 31 January order of the court upholding the enforceability of the arbitral award passed against the Singh brothers and others. Justice Jayant Nath further passed an order for appointment of a chartered accountant (CA) for valuation of assets attached till date. The judge also asked the parties to cooperate with the CA by providing all documents required for valuation.

On 26 February, all assets disclosed by Oscar Investments Ltd and RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd, owned by the Singh brothers, were also attached by an order of the high court.

N.K. Kaul, appearing for the Singh brothers, said legal proceedings challenging the findings of the arbitral award were listed for final disposal before a Singapore court from 9-13 April.

The award passed by a Singapore tribunal had found the Singh brothers and others guilty of making false claims in a self-assessment report, and of misrepresenting and concealing the “genesis, nature and severity of the US regulatory investigations” into Ranbaxy when Daiichi bought their 34.82% stake for $2.4 billion in 2008.

New Delhi: A parliamentary panel has recommended earmarking of a defined portion of proceeds from divestment of state-owned enterprises for funding revival, restructuring and modernisation proposals of sick public sector units (PSUs) that have the potential to turn around.

“In this manner, the government can extend a hand-holding support to the select sick PSUs that have the potential to turn around and sustain themselves in future,” the panel said in a report.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had asked the think-tank to look into the viability of sick state-run companies. The Aayog has already recommended strategic divestment of 40 sick public sector units.

In its report, the parliamentary standing committee on industry said it is of the firm opinion that while making a decision to disinvest PSUs, especially those that are profit making, the government must accord due consideration to the jobs supported by them, the track record of their contribution to the national economy, their capital expenditure creation potential and also their role in balancing the social/regional fabric.

People privy of the developement said GAIL is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in the project at Rs996.28 crore.

New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.

GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.

But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs996.28 crore.

This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17%, then to 15.5% and now about 9%, sources privy to the development said.

“It doesn’t make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,” they said.

The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs30,000 crore.

After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19% stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date.

People privy of the development said when project cost was revised to Rs19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company’s board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs1,000 crore.

Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But when the project cost went up further to Rs21,396 crore, the promoter’s equity contribution increased from Rs5,860.5 crore to Rs6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio.

GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved—Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5% stake. Now that the project cost almost touched Rs30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9% stake.

Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5% stake, did not make more equity contributions.

Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s National Agricultural Development Co., part owned by the sovereign wealth fund, will acquire Danone SA’s venture in the country, creating one of the kingdom’s largest dairy producers.

Nadec, as the company is known, will fund the acquisition of privately held Al Safi Danone through a capital increase of 536 million riyals ($143 million), it said in a statement to the Saudi stock market Sunday. Once the deal is completed, existing Nadec shareholders will own 61.25% of the company, and Al Safi shareholders will hold 38.75%.

“The transaction will allow both companies to better serve customers and realize benefits not available on a standalone basis,” Abdulaziz Al Babtain, managing director of Nadec, said in the statement. “It will create a platform for future growth and, importantly, drive significant value creation for shareholders.”

Nadec shares rose as much as 8.4% to 40.70 riyals ($10.86). They closed at 39.38 riyals ($10.51), the highest since September 2014.

Merger and acquisition activity in Saudi Arabia is picking up as slower economic growth encourages companies to combine to save costs, while new takeover rules make it easier to complete deals.

Sahara Petrochemical and Saudi International Petrochemical Co. said they were evaluating a merger earlier this month. HSBC Holdings Plc-backed Saudi British Bank and Alawwal Bank, in which Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc owns a 40% stake, are in talks to merge, as are hospital operators Al Hammadi Co. for Development & Investment and National Medical Care Co.

67,What Facebook’s privacy policy allows may surprise you,https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/67ivY7pGDT0jUkQKJDFEVN/What-Facebooks-privacy-policy-allows-may-surprise-you.html,You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid,"Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it’s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Photo: Reuters

New York: To get an idea of the data Facebook collects about you, just ask for it. You’ll get a file with every photo and comment you’ve posted, all the ads you’ve clicked on, stuff you’ve liked and searched for and everyone you’ve friended — and unfriended — over the years.

This trove of data is used to decide which ads to show you. It also makes using Facebook more seamless and enjoyable — say, by determining which posts to emphasize in your feed, or reminding you of friends’ birthdays.

Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that’s relatively clear and concise. But few users bother to read it. You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid.

Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. While past privacy debacles have centered on what marketers gather on users, the stakes are higher this time because the firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society.

Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it’s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users. Thanks largely to years of privacy scandals and pressure from users and regulators, Facebook also offers a complex set of controls that let users limit how their information is used — to a point.

You can turn off ad targeting and see generic ads instead, the way you would on television or in a newspaper. In the ad settings, you’d need to uncheck all your interests, interactions with companies and websites and other personal information you don’t want to use in targeting. Of course, if you click on a new interest after this, you’ll have to go back and uncheck it in your ad preferences to prevent targeting. It’s a tedious task.

As Facebook explains, it puts you in target categories based on your activity. So, if you are 35, live in Seattle and have liked an outdoor adventure page, Facebook may show you an ad for a mountain bike shop in your area.

But activity isn’t limited to pages or posts you like, comments you make and your use of outside apps and websites.

“If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them too,” Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent techno-sociologist, said in a 2017 TED talk .

And, increasingly, Facebook tries to match what it knows about you with your offline data, purchased from data brokers or gathered in other ways. The more information it has, the fuller the picture of you it can offer to advertisers. It can infer things about you that you had no intention of sharing — anything from your ethnicity to personality traits, happiness and use of addictive substances, Tufekci said.

These types of data collection aren’t necessarily explicit in privacy policies or settings.

What Facebook does say is that advertisers don’t get the raw data. They just tell Facebook what kind of people they want their ads to reach, then Facebook makes the matches and shows the ads.

Apps can also collect a lot of data about you, as revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The firm got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million.

Facebook says Cambridge Analytica got the data inappropriately — but only because the app said it collected data for research rather than political profiling. Gathering data on friends was permitted at the time, even if they had never installed the app or given explicit consent.

Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech communications professor who built a tongue-in-cheek game called “Cow Clicker” in 2010, wrote in The Atlantic recently that abusing the Facebook platform for “deliberately nefarious ends” was easy to do then. What’s worse, he said, it was hard to avoid extracting private data.

If “you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior,” he wrote. “I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood.”

Facebook has since restricted the amount of types of data apps can access. But other types of data collection are still permitted. For this reason, it’s a good idea to check all the apps you’ve given permissions to over the years. You can also do this in your settings.",What Facebook’s privacy policy allows may surprise you,"['youve', 'data', 'users', 'collection', 'allows', 'facebook', 'privacy', 'information', 'ads', 'cow', 'surprise', 'policy', 'facebooks']","Facebook defends its data collection and sharing activities by noting that it’s adhering to a privacy policy it shares with users.
Facebook claims to protect all this information, and it lays out its terms in a privacy policy that’s relatively clear and concise.
You might be surprised at what Facebook’s privacy policy allows — and what’s left unsaid.
Facebook’s privacy practices have come under fire after a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users.

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday arrested Tottempudi Salalith and Tottempudi Kavita, the promoters of Totem Infrastructure Ltd, in connection with an alleged Rs1,394-crore bank fraud perpetrated against a consortium of eight lenders, officials said.

CBI had named Totem Infrastructure, which worked as a sub-contractor for several major infra firms, and its promoters in a first investigation report (FIR) filed on the basis of a complaint from Union Bank of India, one of the eight banks, the officials quoted above said.

Union Bank alleged in the complaint that it suffered a loss of Rs313.84 crore as the loans given to the company had become non-performing asset (NPA) in June 2012.

Accoring to the officials, the total dues of Totem Infrastructure towards the consortium stands at Rs1394.43 crore. It is alleged that the loans taken from the banks for various projects were diverted for purposes and to the personal bank accounts of the promoters.

Totem Infrastructure figured in income tax department’s list of the biggest tax defaulters in 2015 with an outstanding tax of over Rs400 crore.

San Francisco/Singapore:Uber Technologies Inc. has reached an agreement to sell its Southeast Asian ride-hailing business to rival Grab and could announce the deal as early as Monday morning in Singapore, people familiar with the matter said.

The agreement—which includes all of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia as well as Uber Eats in the region—gives Uber a stake of between 25% and 30% in the new combined business, the people said, asking not to be identified ahead of an official announcement.

The deal, which Bloomberg outlined earlier this month, marks Uber’s operational exit from yet another major market and hands a victory to Grab as it battles local competitor Go-Jek.

SoftBank Group Corp., a major backer of Grab’s and Uber’s as well as China’s Didi Chuxing, has pushed consolidation to improve the profitability of a global ride-hailing business that bleeds billions of dollars a year. New entrants and the strength of second-place regional players such as Lyft Inc. in the U.S. has complicated those efforts.

Representatives for Grab and Uber declined to comment.

The deal represents another major retreat from international markets for Uber. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive officer, sold Uber’s business in China in 2016 in return for a 17.5% stake in Chinese ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing. Then Uber agreed to sell its Russian business to Yandex—just before after Dara Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive.

Khosrowshahi has been pushing to clean up the company’s financials in preparations for an initial public offering next year. Pulling out of markets like Southeast Asia would boost profits at a company that has burned through $10.7 billion since its founding nine years ago. Khosrowshahi signaled during a trip through Asia last month that he is committed to key markets such as Japan and India.

New Delhi: Realty firm Embassy group will invest Rs1,350 crore to develop four new hotels in Bengaluru as part of its expansion plan in hospitality business.

Bengaluru-based Embassy group, which is a leading player in commercial real estate in the country with huge portfolio of office assets, has already roped in global hospitality major Hilton to manage these hotels. “We have two operational hotels with around 450 keys and a Four Seasons hotel having 220 keys will open by August this year,” Embassy group president, hospitality business, Sartaj Singh told PTI.

The company is developing four new hotels comprising 1,120 keys, which will take the total number of rooms to 1,700-1800, he added. Asked about the investment, Singh said it would be around Rs1,350 crore and the same would be funded through internal accruals. These four new hotels would be operational by 2022.

Global private equity major Blackstone is also a partner in some of the hotel projects. Last week, Embassy group tied up with Hilton for 500-room dual-branded hotel featuring Hilton Hotels & Resorts and a Hilton Garden Inn hotel. These two hotels will be located within the 100-acre Embassy TechVillage Business Park in south Bengaluru.

The 300-room Hilton and the 200-room Hilton Garden Inn will offer two different price points to corporate users. Embassy group had earlier signed the first dual-branded 620-keys twin hotels at Embassy Manyata Business Park.

Singh said the four dual branded hotels will also have convention centres. Embassy group has two operational hotels—‘Hilton Bangalore Embassy Golf Links’ having around 250 keys and Le Meridien hotel with 200 keys. Embassy group’s CMD Jitu Virwani said: “Using Embassy’s proven expertise in project development, we are focused on delivering landmark hotels that will provide an elevated service for our corporate occupiers within their work environment.”

Embassy is one of the leading property developers in India. It has developed over 45 million sq. ft of prime commercial, residential and retail space in India as well as Malaysia and Serbia. Hilton is a leading global hospitality company with a portfolio of 14 world-class brands comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries.","Embassy group to invest Rs1,350 crore in four new hotels","['operational', 'keys', 'hospitality', 'group', 'rs1350', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'invest', 'embassy', 'hilton', 'crore', 'hotels', 'leading']","Embassy group is developing four new hotels comprising 1,120 keys, which will take the total number of rooms to 1,700-1800.

New Delhi: A merger of state-run trading firms MMTC and STC is on the cards and the matter is under process, commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu has said.

“That is something which is already on cards because STC unfortunately has become a sick company. Therefore, there are some measures which are being taken already and this matter is under process,” Prabhu told PTI.

He said this while replying to a question whether the government is moving ahead on the proposal to merge Metals & Minerals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) and State Trading Corporation (STC).

STC, Project & Equipment Corporation of India (PEC) and MMTC are under the administrative control of the ministry. Earlier, the commerce ministry had commissioned a study to work out a new structure for three state-owned trading firms MMTC, STC and PEC.

While the government wholly owns PEC, it has about 90% stake in MMTC and STC. The merger of MMTC and STC would result in synergy of operations.

MMTC and STC were created in 1963 and 1956, respectively. PEC Ltd was carved out of the STC in 1971-72.

According to industry observers, these state trading companies have lost their relevance as well as business following liberalisation. MMTC used to be a canalising agency for import and export of non-ferrous metals and fertilisers. Similarly, STC was a canalising agency for imports of essential items of mass consumption such as wheat, pulses, sugar and edible oils. PEC was engaged in export and import of machinery and railway equipment.

In 2016-17, MMTC incurred a loss of about Rs30 crore. STC too reported a loss of Rs16.5 crore in the last fiscal.","STC, MMTC merger on cards, says Suresh Prabhu","['pec', 'industry', 'prabhu', 'trading', 'corporation', 'state', 'stc', 'cards', 'mmtc', 'suresh', 'merger', 'commerce']","Commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu.

New Delhi: Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s elder son Akash will marry his schoolmate Shloka Mehta, the youngest daughter of diamantaire Russell Mehta, in early December.

The development confirms PTI news break of 4 March that Sholka is the one the Ambani family had chosen for Akash.

People aware of the development said the two families and close friends gathered at a plush five-star resort in Goa on Saturday for a ‘get-to-know-each-other’ before the formal engagement. Though the two families have been talking to each other for the wedding for sometime now, the plans were formalised at the Goa event, which was planned before Holi.

The marriage is planned for early December, with celebrations spread across 4-5 days, they said, adding the possible dates may be 8-12 December at the Oberoi, Mumbai.

While e-mails sent to both families remained unanswered, pictures of the Saturday event are available on social media. Besides parents Mukesh and Nita Ambani, grandmother Kokilaben was also present at the event.

Akash is the eldest son of India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani and Shloka Mehta is the daughter of Russell Mehta, who heads Rosy Blue Diamonds.

A person close to the Ambani family had discounted the then talk of 24 March being the engagement date, saying “No dates of either the wedding or engagement of Akash Ambani have been finalised.”

“As and when any good news is to be shared, the family will be delighted to share with everyone,” the person had said then.

Akash and twin sister Isha are the eldest of the three children of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. Akash is on the board of Reliance Jio, the group’s fast growing telecom venture.

Shloka, who after finishing schooling at Dhirubhai Ambani International School in 2009 went on to study anthropology at Princeton University and did her masters in law at the London School of Economics and Political Science, is a director on Rosy Blue Foundation since July 2014.

New Delhi: Punjab National Bank (PNB) plans to take part in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond, a group company of jewellery designer Nirav Modi who has been accused of defrauding the state-run bank of nearly Rs13,000 crore.

The bank is exploring all options for the recovery, including participating in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond Inc, officials said.

According to officials, the bank is in the process of hiring legal experts to take the matter forward.

The legal firm would be hired soon. Various pros and cons are being examined in order to make watertight case for the recovery, officials said, adding the bank is part of unsecured creditor category.

When contacted, PNB declined to comment on the matter. Last month, Firestar Diamond, a company owned by Nirav Modi filed for bankruptcy in a New York court. The US Trustee Program oversees administration and litigation for enforcement of the bankruptcy law.

Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi in connivance with certain bank officials allegedly cheated the PNB of Rs12,968 crore through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs). A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Nirav Modi since March 2011.

Different investigating agencies, including Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate, are probing the fraud, dubbed as the biggest banking scam in the country.

Scam-hit PNB had issued as many as 1,590 LoUs to Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and their associates. The total number of LoUs issued to the companies of Nirav Modi, his relatives and the Nirav Modi Group are 1,213, and to Mehul Choksi, his relatives and the Gitanjali Group are 377. The amount of repayment made by the companies against each LoU cannot be currently ascertained as the matter is under investigation, finance ministry in a reply to Parliament had said.

PNB has apprised that payment of LoU is a contingent liability and may fall back upon the bank on due date only if the same is not paid on or before due date by the buyer.

Vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu has a SWEET recipe for improving corporate governance at Indian firms: Segregation of ownership and control; Wealth creation, of which profits will be a by-product; Efficiency of decision-making and resource use; Ethical and environmental commitments; and Transparency through accountability.

Speaking at the Mint Corporate Strategy Awards 2018 in Mumbai on Friday, Naidu said, “Corporate governance is a key element in improving economic efficiency and growth as well as enhancing investors’ confidence.” The theme of the awards was corporate governance.

The Mint Corporate Strategy Awards 2018 are the result of a year’s hard work. The awards have considered an elaborate methodology for identifying the most qualified companies in four categories, namely, Classical, Adaptive, Shaping and Renewal.

Naidu said that good corporate governance should provide proper incentives for the board and management to pursue objectives that are in the interest of the economy and shareholders and should facilitate effective monitoring. “Effective corporate governance system, within an individual company and across an economy as a whole, helps to provide a degree of confidence that is necessary for proper functioning of a market economy.”

Observing that the economy saw a “temporary dip” in the last two quarters of 2016-17 and the first quarter of 2017-18 due to demonetization and disruptions relating to implementation of the goods and services tax, Naidu, quoting the World Bank, said economic activity began to stabilize from August last year and is expected to clock a growth rate of 6.7% this year.

“As the global economy is looking up, India should take advantage of global conditions to further spur growth. With India turning into an attractive destination for foreign investments and the government’s push to the manufacturing sector through the Make in India programme, it is believed that this sector has the potential to reach $1 trillion by 2025,” he said.

Naidu said that the government has taken many initiatives with a view to doubling the income of farmers by 2022. “One of the biggest challenges is to bridge the urban-rural divide and I feel that the corporate sector should play a bigger role in closing this gap, particularly in education, health and skill development sectors,” he said.

Noting that the government—through liberalization, digital revolution and reforms such as ease of doing business—has sought to cut down red tape and help promote the corporate sector’s growth, Naidu said that some unscrupulous individuals and firms are trying to misuse the system and indulge in fraudulent practices. “In recent times, corporate governance in India has been in the news for reasons more negative than positive. These episodes in my view are a kind of churning from which all the stakeholders of corporate governance need to draw the right lessons for transforming our corporate governance norms at par with the best in the world.”

“Of particular relevance is the relation between corporate governance practices and the increasingly international character of investment. International flows of capital enable companies to access financing from a much larger pool of investors. If the countries are to reap the full benefits of the global capital market and if they are to attract long-term capital, corporate governance arrangements must be credible, well understood across borders and adhere to internationally accepted principles,” Naidu said.

And even if corporations do not rely primarily on foreign sources of capital, adherence to good corporate governance practices will help improve the confidence of domestic investors, reduce the cost of capital, enable good functioning of financial markets and ultimately lead to more stable sources of finance, he added.

Naidu pointed out that India’s distinctive corporate governance issues originate from the high proportion of family-owned companies. “In our country, more than one-third of the companies are controlled by one or more family members in concert with one another. Most family-owned businesses are unable to discern that there lies a dichotomy between the business and the personal affairs of the family. Thus, decisions are often made to suit the family and are not necessarily in the best interest of the firm.”

He urged retail investors to take responsibility for corporate governance. “In our scenario, retail investors are more concerned about the material financial gains on their shareholdings instead of seeking to be active participants in influencing the affairs of the company.”

Other corporate governance issues Naidu highlighted include the need for succession planning, the implication of cross-holdings, ensuring risk management strategies and the board of directors acting as agents of shareholders instead of discharging their duties as a company’s fiduciaries.

“India is on the rise. For the new India to become a reality at the earliest, the corporate sector has an important role to play as a catalyst. We don’t have many corporations with a global presence. You need to reform, perform and transform so that Indian companies can open up new vistas of global opportunities which would in turn benefit our country and its people,” Naidu said.",Venkaiah Naidu’s SWEET recipe for corporate governance,"['investors', 'governance', 'india', 'capital', 'awards', 'global', 'recipe', 'naidu', 'companies', 'sweet', 'venkaiah', 'corporate', 'naidus', 'sector']","Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu at the Mint Corporate Awards 2018 in Mumbai on Friday.

New York/Princeton: It’s been an expensive two months for the 500 wealthiest people on the planet.

Their combined net worth fell $181 billion this week as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered their steepest weekly drop in more than two years amid heated rhetoric over tariffs and retaliation. The group’s wealth has shrunk $436 billion since markets peaked on 26 January.

Mark Zuckerberg bore the brunt this week with $10.3 billion wiped from his fortune on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He dropped three places to seventh on the ranking as scandal unfolded at Facebook Inc. The social network’s shares tumbled 14% following reports that it let Cambridge Analytica amass data on 50 million users.

Bengaluru: Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd (IBREL) has executed definitive transaction documents with global private equity investor Blackstone Group LP to divest 50% stake in subsidiaries Indiabulls Properties Private Ltd and Indiabulls Real Estate Co. Pvt. Ltd at an aggregate enterprise value of $1.46 billion or Rs9,500 crore, the company informed the BSE late Friday.

The two subsidiaries hold premium commercial office assets, Indiabulls Finance Centre and One Indiabulls Centre, in central Mumbai.

The transaction is expected to be concluded by March end.

“Substantial part of sale proceeds would be utilized towards repayment of existing debt of the company and its subsidiaries, and for achieving sustainable long term growth and for further strengthening of their on-going businesses,” Indiabulls said.

Once this transaction is concluded, the company will cease its sole control over the two subsidiaries IPPL and IRECPL, Indiabulls added.

Mint reported on 22 March that Indiabulls is also planning to monetise its residential and commercial properties in Chennai, the latter being a non-core market for the Mumbai-based developer.

On Friday, the company said that the consent of the board is being sought for the sale of Chennai assets, under its subsidiary India Land and Properties Ltd. Blackstone’s real estate arm has committed around $4.1 billion across 27 investments in India, making it possibly the largest owner of commercial office assets in the country.

Earlier this week, Mint reported that Blackstone is set to buy an 80% stake in Nitesh Hub, a shopping mall in Pune’s Koregaon Park from real estate firm Nitesh Estates Ltd for around Rs310 crore.","Indiabulls to sell stake in assets to Blackstone at enterprise valuation of Rs9,500 crore","['enterprise', 'company', 'transaction', 'subsidiaries', 'indiabulls', 'blackstone', 'properties', 'valuation', 'rs9500', 'concluded', 'assets', 'commercial', 'crore', 'sell', 'estate', 'stake', 'real']","Once this transaction is concluded, the company will cease its sole control over the two subsidiaries IPPL and IRECPL, Indiabulls said.

New Delhi: The Union government on Thursday signalled a zero-tolerance approach to white-collar crime, approving a new law targeting economic offenders fleeing the country, and creating a regulator for chartered accountants and audit firms.

The actions, coming two weeks after Punjab National Bank (PNB) went public with a multi-billion dollar fraud, are part of a series of steps the government has initiated to mitigate the financial and political fallout of the scam.

These include banking and bankruptcy reforms, disqualification of directors of errant companies, striking shell companies off the records and stringent action taken by various regulators in the last few weeks against those who allegedly duped banks. Thursday’s cabinet decisions are expected to create a deterrent to economic offenders fleeing the country and make auditors more accountable for their actions.

The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018, which will be tabled when the budget session of Parliament resumes, provides for proclaiming an economic offender who has fled the country as a fugitive, issuing an arrest warrant against the person and confiscating his or her assets before conviction.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who briefed reporters about the decision, said that the bill provides for confiscating all assets of such offenders including any benami assets (held by proxies), not just the proceeds of crime. “In future, there will be a mechanism for international cooperation too. We will need an appropriate arrangement with other nations to confiscate overseas assets of such offenders,” Jaitley said.

Only offences above Rs100 crore will be pursued under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018 in order to prevent overcrowding of courts.

At the same time, the government has decided to set up a National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to regulate auditors. Creating such a body was first proposed in the Companies Act, 2013.

Once it is created, NFRA can impose a penalty of up to five times the fee received in the case of professional or other misconduct by individual chartered accountants and up to 10 times the fees received in the case of audit firms. It can also bar an auditor up to 10 years. NFRA will probe professional misconduct of auditors in all listed companies and in large unlisted companies, the size of which will be specified in the rules, an official statement said.

Over the past few weeks, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the income-tax department, among others, have frozen bank accounts and seized properties of jewellery designer Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. Companies linked to Modi and Choksi are allegedly involved in the PNB fraud, the size of which has been now revised to Rs12,636 crore. Separately, investigative agencies have seized assets of Rotomac group, which has defaulted on Rs3,695 crore worth of loans.

On Thursday, ED attached 41 properties worth Rs1,217 crore belonging to Choksi and his Gitanjali group.

Modi, Choksi and liquor magnate Vijay Mallya, all of whom are wanted by one investigative agency or the other, have fled the country. Mallya’s spokesperson and Choksi’s lawyer declined to comment for the story. Calls and messages to the lawyer representing Nirav Modi remained unanswered till press time.

“Clearly, the current regulations have not been successful to get auditors to work independently. This body (NFRA) and the rules framed should achieve this objective. This should reinstate confidence in audits and financial statements of companies and financial institutions,” said Daksha Baxi, executive director of law firm Khaitan & Co.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, CBI arrested former PNB chief manager Bishnubrata Mishra. He was responsible for concurrent audit at the bank during 2011-2015.

Mumbai: Even as harsh legislation to punish fugitive economic offenders takes shape in India, 31 individuals accused of fraud and economic offences are holed up abroad, the ministry of external affairs said.

These people, pursued by the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 15 different cases, collectively owe Rs40,000 crore to banks and public institutions in India, calculations by Mint based on investigation reports show.

The list of fugitives that the ministry of external affairs submitted in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday includes some well-known names and some not-so-well-known ones.

Among the prominent names are Vijay Mallya, who owes Rs9,000 crore to a group of banks; Nirav Modi, his wife Ami Modi, brother Neeshal Modi and uncle Mehul Choksi, named in the Rs12,636 crore fraud at Punjab National Bank; Jatin Mehta of Winsome Diamonds, who owes Rs7,000 crore; former Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi, accused of siphoning off Rs125 crore from the country’s cricket board; and Sterling Biotech Ltd directors Chetan Jayantilal Sandesara and Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara for alleged bank fraud of Rs5,000 crore.

The lesser-known names include Ashish Jobanputra, promoter of Mumbai-based textile export firm ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd, and his wife in a bill discounting scam of Rs770 crore and for causing losses to banks; diamond trader Ritesh Jain for illegally taking Rs1,500 crore out of the country; Surender Singh, Angad Singh and Harsahib Singh for cheating and criminal conspiracy; Sabhya Seth for a fraud of Rs390 crore against Oriental Bank of Commerce; and Sanjay Bhandari for alleged tax evasion of Rs150 crore.

Nilesh Parekh of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, accused of a Rs2,223 crore bank fraud, was arrested by CBI last year after he returned to India to join the probe. There is little to no public information about the rest of the names.

Experts say legislation to target fugitive economic offenders will act as a deterrent and could also be used retrospectively in some cases.

“The legislation is not stated to be retrospective in effect. However, directors of enforcement agencies can make an application to declare any person as ‘fugitive economic offender’ if the said person either leaves or has left India in order to avoid criminal prosecution and/or refuses to return to India to face criminal prosecution. Therefore, for offences which have been committed even before the coming into effect of the bill as an Act, it will help,” said Sandeep Grover, partner at law firm IndusLaw.

Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd has been declared the successful resolution applicant for Bhushan Steel Ltd by the committee of creditors (CoC), the firm said in a stock exchange notification on Friday. The resolution plan finalized by the creditors will now need approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

In a report dated 7 March, Mint said Tata Steel has emerged as the highest bidder for the debt-ridden steel firm, outbidding JSW Steel Ltd.

Bhushan Steel owes about Rs44,000 crore to its creditors. As per the resolution plan, Tata Steel has offered upfront cash of about Rs34,800 crore to the financial creditors, along with Rs1,200 crore to operational creditors.

Even as the steel firm’s resolution plan has been finalized by CoC, pending cases against the firm in Kolkata NCLT can create hurdles for its bid.

Tata Steel had also participated in the bidding for Electrosteel Steels Ltd. Its bid, however, has been challenged by Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd.

According to a plea filed by Renaissance Steel, Tata Steel is ineligible as a bidder under the insolvency and bankruptcy code on account of several criminal cases against the firm in the UK. The petition alleges Tata Steel UK Ltd, a unit of Tata Steel, has faced multiple prosecutions and had pleaded guilty to violating the UK Health and Safety Act several times. It also said that even as the offences were punishable with two years in jail, the UK authorities chose to impose fines.

Meanwhile , Kolkata NCLT has sought a response from resolution professional Dhaivat Anjaria explaining the criteria on the basis of which Tata Steel has been declared eligible.

81,Punit Goenka: The mark of Z,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/qDaZ1JBw7sW1tEbX8UCr1N/Punit-Goenka-The-mark-of-Z.html,"The managing director and chief executive officer of Zee Entertainment Enterprises on his triumphs, missteps, and the virtues of focusing on a single task","Punit Goenka remembers the exact moment he stopped seeing viewership numbers on Fridays.

In 2005, Zee launched a prime-time show called Saat Phere. It was an important series for them, and Goenka, then business head for Zee TV, was eager to know how it had done. He left office on Thursday night at around 9.30, assuming he would see the numbers on Friday morning, as he did normally. But an SMS he received congratulating him on the show was a rude surprise—he realized that the ratings actually came out on Thursday nights; it was just that his team would see them on Friday mornings.

“That’s when I called my entire team, and that was the first firing they got from me,” he says. He told them: “From now on, we’ll see the ratings on Thursday night, discuss them, plan what has to be done, and then I’ll take you out for drinks and dinner.”

I’m on the 16th floor of a Lower Parel high-rise, the Mumbai headquarters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (Zeel), part of the Essel Group, which has been run by Goenka’s family for over 90 years. Goenka, Zee’s 42-year-old managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), is sitting across from me on the other side of a large table, in his spacious office. We’re 6 hours into Goenka’s workday, the office end of which usually wraps up by around 7.30pm. After that, it’s “business over social activity”, meeting with colleagues or business interests over a drink, till 9pm. Then it’s home to the family: wife Shreyasi, an art patron and co-director of the Saat Saath Arts Foundation, and their daughter and two sons.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises is divided into six verticals: domestic broadcast, international broadcast, digital, movies, music and live events. In the days leading up to our meeting, though, it was the digital, or OTT (over the top), division, headed by younger brother Amit (also CEO, international broadcast business), which was on Goenka’s mind. A few days before I met Goenka, the network had launched Zee5, a part-free, part-subscription streaming platform which subsumed Zee’s earlier platforms, Ozee and

Ditto TV.

With a host of streaming options—Hotstar, Amazon Prime, ALTBalaji and Netflix are just a few—available to the Indian consumer, Zee5 has its work cut out. Goenka says they plan to release one new original series every month. Episodes of original series like The Story (Hindi) and Nanna Koochi (Telugu) are already available to stream; there’s also a series about drug trafficking by director Q, starring Naseeruddin Shah, in the pipeline. “I think maybe six months into the launch is the right time to take a call on whether original content (is working),” Goenka says, “once we have a critical mass of consumers”.

I ask if the content of the digital space might turn off some existing TV viewers of Zee who sign up. “What we cater to on TV is a slightly elder audience base,” Goenka says. “The TV audience will come to Zee5 to do catch-up if they’ve missed out on something.” Though he admits that the “ecosystem” of streaming TV is still being built in the country, he says he would be disappointed if OTT platforms didn’t contribute 10-12% of his total revenue numbers in the next three-five years.

Goenka grew up and studied in several towns and cities—Hisar in Haryana; Delhi; Sanawar in Himachal Pradesh; Mumbai—before being sent to Institut Le Rosey, a boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland. He wasn’t an avid sportsperson, but made it to the school rugby team (his weight worked to his advantage, he says). More importantly, he learnt how to ski, an activity which remains a passion even today. He was, he freely admits, an average student. Back in India, he dropped out after a year from the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics and started working.

“I was always clear from the beginning that I will be in the family business,” Goenka says. His father, Subhash Chandra, Rajya Sabha member and founder and chairman of Zee and the Essel Group, started Zee TV in 1992; it became the most popular TV channel in a newly liberalized India. But Goenka had to learn the ropes first, training within the Essel Group. His first assignment, in 1993, was selling amusement park packages for EsselWorld to schools in Virar, Mumbai. He was assistant to the head of Essel Packaging, the floor supervisor of a factory, and executive assistant to his father for six months. He was then sent to Zee Music Records—a business he soon shut down. “Zee would not do cash dealings,” he says. “Four years ago, we re-entered (the music business) and now we’re doing pretty well, because it’s all moved to digital.”

Goenka was put in charge of organizing funding for Agrani—a programme to launch the group’s own satellite. He helped launch Dish TV, working with his uncle, Jawahar Goel, for a year in Delhi, “living out of a suitcase”. He then came back to Mumbai and ran Zee Sports. In 2005, he was made business head of Zee TV; in time, he was running the content for the entire network. In 2008, he took over as CEO from Pradeep Guha.

The Hindi general entertainment channels (GEC) market in the 1990s and early 2000s was limited to a couple of big entities, which put a lot of pressure on new shows to succeed. When Goenka became content head, he realized they needed to diversify. “I still remember those days where Zee ratings used to fluctuate and the Zee stock price would fluctuate. It was that volatile. I decided to invest disproportionately in regional markets.”

He also created his own working style. His father and he, Goenka says, are “opposite”. “He’s a self-made entrepreneur. His urgency of doing things is different from mine.” Goenka remembers the early days, when he had to argue for time for his diversification efforts to come good. “(My father) can multitask like nobody else. But I bring in the focus on one thing, and get it right.”

One thing he got wrong was entering the movie business in 2008, once he took over as CEO of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (“It was my first big failure”). Within a year, they pulled out of Hindi film production, though they continued producing Marathi films. Over the last several years—coinciding with Marathi cinema’s rise as an art-house cinema leader—they have become unlikely tastemakers, producing critically lauded titles like Elizabeth Ekadashi (2014), Killa (2014) and Natsamrat (2016). In Sairat (2015), they achieved a rare double, a critical favourite and a smash hit.

Their slate for 2018 looks just as impressive: Ravi Jadhav’s Nude, and their first entry into international prestige cinema: Beyond The Clouds, by Iranian director Majid Majidi. They have also re-entered the Hindi movie arena, though they’re stepping more cautiously this time, trying to lead with script-driven, rather than star-centric, projects.

Goenka likes to remain involved with the details of what his network is putting on air or on the big screen. He still takes narrations for new shows or movies, and, whenever he finds time, he’ll watch an episode of a show currently airing and text the department head with feedback. He doesn’t get much time to watch for pleasure—mainly on flights or on the treadmill in the mornings. Game Of Thrones is too much of an investment, he says, but he unwinds with a comedy, anything from The Big Bang Theory to Friends. He avoids watching his Indian competitors. “When I do that, I end up confusing my core audience base with theirs. The Zee core audience base is middle India—the stories, the characters are far more real, they don’t live in palaces, they don’t wear chiffon saris.”

Goenka has a trip to Switzerland coming up, which he’s visibly excited about, because it will give him a chance to catch up on some skiing. “It’s a stress-buster for me,” he says. “It gives me time to think.” He had initially taken up skiing because it was the one sport he could do on his own. “You didn’t need a team. It would just be me, skiing alone.” Nowadays, he still skis alone when he travels abroad, though he says his daughter, 15, is approaching his skill level and joins him sometimes.-

The next goal is to make Zee a more broad-based entertainment conglomerate. “In the next three years, we will be the largest media company in emerging markets and the largest media company in India,” he told Business Today in January 2017. He says he’s looking “aggressively” at the live entertainment space. “We haven’t succeeded so far because it’s a highly unorganized and fragmented market,” he says. “Now that the film business is back on track and the Zee5 launch is done, I’ll look at the live business and shape that.”

During our conversation, Goenka—who quit smoking cigarettes five months ago—puffs on a nifty-looking electronic tobacco device called IQOS, which heats tobacco instead of burning it (maker Philip Morris claims it reduces the risk of tobacco-related diseases compared with cigarettes). He is trying to be healthier, watch his diet. He hasn’t taken up a sport apart from skiing, but he works out on the treadmill as often as he can. He took up weight training for a while, then stopped. “I don’t like drastic changes,” he explains. He talks about becoming hands-off when it comes to certain parts of the business, then checks himself. “Well, not entirely hands-off.”",Punit Goenka: The mark of Z,"['business', 'mark', 'series', 'zee', 'goenka', 'head', 'zee5', 'z', 'skiing', 'punit', 'entertainment', 'tv', 'team']","Punit Goenka remembers the exact moment he stopped seeing viewership numbers on Fridays.

Bengaluru: The maker of Bira 91, a popular Indian craft beer with bottles sporting sketches of a quirky monkey with a punk hairdo, is aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) in the next three to five years, its chief executive told Reuters.

B9 Beverages, founded and led by New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations in a country where marketing of alcohol is heavily regulated.

Jain puts it down to the fact that the taste of beer matters to Indian consumers now much more than before. “Younger consumers have a different perception about alcohol,” he said.

Craft beer sales are on the rise in India as younger, affluent consumers in big cities choose brands and pubs that make lighter brews and promise fresher ingredients.

Bira expects its India business to break even in fiscal 2019 and revenue to more than double to about Rs400 crore.

Set up in 2015, B9 Beverages initially manufactured Bira 91—the name references India’s international phone code—in Belgium but supply chain snafus and high costs made it difficult to compete against market leaders Kingfisher, SAB Miller India and Carlsberg.

The supply issues were resolved, Jain said, after he started production in India in late 2016. The company still sources toddy for Bira’s wheat variant, Bira White, from Canada or Europe to ensure quality.

The idea to start the business grew out of Jain’s personal search for good-quality beer after he repatriated to India from the US, where craft beer is hugely popular.

After sputtering efforts to get his fledgling company off the ground, Jain received investments from local venture capitalists and, later, from US-based Sequoia Capital.

Jain, owns 35 percent of the company.

B9 has raised about $30 million in four funding rounds so far. Jain said the company had sufficient funds and was not looking to raise money in the short term.

Still niche

Euromonitor International pegged beer sales in India at 3.1 billion litres last year and expects it to grow to 3.3 billon litres this year.

Jain reckons Bira 91 has a 5% share of the beer market in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Notwithstanding Bira’s success, craft beer is expected to remain a niche market in India in the near future as stronger brews remain a firm favorite, especially in smaller cities, and cost conscious consumers pick cheaper alternatives.

A 330 ml bottle of Kingfisher Strong Premium, which has 8% alcohol content, sells at Rs68 in Bengaluru. In contrast, a bottle of Bira White, with 4.9% alcohol, retails at Rs110.

Bira recently launched a variant with 7% alcohol content.

While the company has a headstart in the domestic craft beer market, it is expected to face competition from global rivals and other Indian brands looking to enter the market.

Bengaluru-based United Breweries Ltd, which dominates the Indian beer market with its Kingfisher Strong beer, has said it plans to launch a craft beer brand by the end of 2018.

But Jain is upbeat about Bira’s prospects.

“We are beginning to see a data point where Bira is not just sort of dominating premium, but actually taking share away from mass market brands. So consumers are actually trading up, paying more for beer that’s more flavourful and resonates with them.” Reuters",Bira beer maker B9 Beverages planning IPO in 3-5 years,"['consumers', 'indian', 'beverages', 'india', 'bira', 'craft', 'b9', 'ipo', '35', 'planning', 'alcohol', 'jain', 'share', 'maker', 'beer', 'market']","Bira 91, founded and led by Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations.

Mumbai: Stock exchanges on Friday accepted the request of Uttam Galva Steels Ltd to reclassify ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV as a public shareholder in the company, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

“Uttam Galva had written to the exchanges on 9 March asking that ArcelorMittal be reclassified as a public shareholder. The exchanges agreed it was a technical issue. While National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) granted reclassification on 22 March, BSE Ltd did it today,” said one of the two people cited above, on condition of anonymity.

While BSE declined to comment, an email sent to NSE was not answered till press time.

The reclassification was important for ArcelorMittal as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) prevents promoters from bidding for assets of an insolvent firm. Uttam Galva is in the second list of NPA (non-performing asset) accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for resolution. Promoter status would have prevented ArcelorMittal from bidding for Uttam Galva as and when it was referred for resolution under IBC.

The reclassification was a technical issue as prior to 7 February 2018, ArcelorMittal held 29.05% of the share capital in Uttam Galva and was named as one of its promoters. On 7 February, ArcelorMittal sold its entire stake to Sainath Trading Co. Pvt. Ltd in an off-market sale.

As per existing norms, exchanges allow reclassification of promoter status on a case-to-case basis.

“In a case where a person does not hold a single share and does not exercise any direct or indirect control over the firm or has any special rights through any formal or informal arrangements, receiving approval of declassification of that person from stock exchanges or market regulator is a matter of procedure. Of course, bourses do examine the bona fides of the applicant so as to not allow misuse,” said Sumit Agrawal, a partner at Suvan Law Advisors. He represents ArcelorMittal.

Meanwhile, Numetal Mauritius Ltd has filed a separate plea challenging the decision of the committee of creditors disqualifying it as a bidder for Essar Steel. Numetal and ArcelorMittal were the two firms that had submitted bids for Essar Steel. Numetal was disqualified under section 29(a) of the IBC as Aurora Enterprises Ltd, owned by a trust controlled by Rewant Ruia, holds a minority stake in the firm.

Although, Numetal had filed a petition on 20 March at the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal seeking clarification on its eligibility in anticipation of its bid being disqualified, the firm filed a separate application challenging the committee of creditors’ decision on 22 March, seeking an earlier hearing date, said a person close to the development. The case will be heard on 27 March. The tentative deadline for fresh bids is 2 April.

Mumbai: Lenders to Jyoti Structures Ltd will meet next week to put the only resolution bid received for the debt-laden company to vote, said two people close to the development. The decision of the committee of creditors (CoC) will be crucial for Jyoti Structures as the 270-days window to resolve the account ends on 31 March.

“Only one bid has been received which has already been evaluated by creditors. In order to pass the resolution plan, voting will be conducted on Monday,” said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity. The voting outcome will be declared on Tuesday, he added.

The resolution professional for Jyoti Structures had invited bids from resolution applicants between 12 September and 29 December. The firm had received a single bid from a group of high net worth individuals led by Sharad Sanghi, managing director and chief executive at Netmagic Solutions. Sanghi is also backed by others, including Manish Kejriwal, managing partner at Kedaara Capital Advisors LLP and Madhu Kela, who was previously the chief investment strategist at Reliance Capital Ltd. Garg declined to comment citing confidentiality.

To be sure, of the 12 debt-laden firms referred by the Reserve Bank of India on 13 June 2017 for resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC), Jyoti Structures was the first account to be admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal for resolution.

State Bank of India is the lead bank.

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, on Friday said it will invest Rs1,600 crore to set up a manufacturing plant in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.

The company already has five manufacturing units in India and one each in Colombia and Bangladesh.

The Delhi-based manufacturer plans to employ 2,000 people directly at the new plant and generate employment opportunities for an additional 10,000 through the creation of a manufacturing ecosystem of vendors and suppliers in the region.

Given the strategic location of the plant, the new manufacturing capacity can also act as a key hub for Hero to export its range of products to some of its key overseas markets, according to a press release issued by the company.

“In addition to building a state-of-the-art facility, we are committed to creating a world class manufacturing ecosystem in the region, with a base of globally benchmarked vendors and suppliers, which will together generate over 12,000 new jobs, thereby accelerating the socio-economic progress in the state,” said Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director, Hero MotoCorp.

The combined installed production capacity of the company is currently 9.2 million units per annum, the highest in the country. With the additional capacity of the Andhra plant, Hero MotoCorp’s combined annual production capacity will reach 11 million units.

“I am personally very glad that Hero MotoCorp–the world’s largest two-wheeler company—is setting-up a manufacturing facility in our state—the company’s first such manufacturing unit in southern India.

The Jio-Saavn deal, will see Reliance Industries buy stake in Saavn for $104 million and invest $100 million for expansion of the music app. Photo: PTI

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-helmed Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic.

In a statement, Reliance said it has executed definitive agreements for the combination of Saavn with JioMusic.

“We are delighted to announce this partnership with Saavn, and believe that their highly experienced management team will be instrumental in expanding Jio-Saavn to an extensive user base, thereby strengthening our leadership position in the Indian streaming market,” Akash Ambani, director at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, said in the statement.

The combined entity is valued at over $1 billion, with JioMusic’s implied valuation at $670 million, the statement added.

Reliance will also invest up to $100 million, out of which a rupee equivalent of $20 million will be invested upfront, for growth and expansion of the platform into one of the largest streaming services in the world.

“The integrated business will be developed into a media platform of the future with global reach, cross-border original content, independent artist marketplace, consolidated data, and one of the largest mobile advertising media,” Reliance said.

Reliance is also acquiring a partial stake from existing shareholders of Saavn for $104 million. The shareholders include Tiger Global Management, Liberty Media and Bertelsmann.

The company will continue to operate the over-the-top media platform available on all app stores.

The three co-founders of Saavn—Rishi Malhotra, Paramdeep Singh and Vinodh Bhat—will continue in their leadership roles and will drive growth of the combined entity.

“Saavn has been at the forefront of the digital music revolution in India. Our partnership with Reliance reinforces our commitment to the growth of our label partners, the independent artist ecosystem, and the overall music industry globally,” said Singh, executive vice-chairman of Saavn.

The Reliance Jio-Saavn deal comes at a time when India’s audio streaming market is on the rise.

According to the FICCI-KPMG Media and Entertainment Industry Report 2017, streaming audio contributed 10% to the total mobile Internet usage in India. The year 2016 saw a spike in music streaming volume with 50-60 million active monthly users on music streaming applications.

With over 300 million Internet-enabled mobile phones in the country and fast reducing tariff rates, this volume is expected to grow rapidly.

To be sure, the latest deal only reinforces Reliance Jio’s entertainment play growing stronger by the day. Last month, the telecom company bought a 5% stake in film production and distribution studio Eros International Plc, in addition to the existing stakes it has acquired in production houses Balaji Telefilms, and Roy Kapur Films in the last eight months.

Reliance launched its LTE mobile network operator Reliance Jio in 2016. By November 2017, it accounted for a 14.5% share of India’s wireless telecom market for the second quarter of the year, besides revenues of Rs6,140 crore for the September quarter and an implied paid subscriber base of around 131 million.

“Reliance has a hugely penetrative market with Jio, which will only get bigger as time passes. How do you fuel content? So this is a step in that direction where you have a content provider for your user base which is a player who has been in this for a long period of time,” said a media analyst on condition of anonymity.

“The investment and combination of our music assets with Saavn underlines our commitment to further boost the digital ecosystem and provide unlimited digital entertainment services to consumers over a strong uninterrupted network,” Akash Ambani said.

Mumbai: After building a sizeable number of economy and mid-scale hotels in India, Europe’s leading hospitality firm AccorHotels has lined up a new pipeline of hotel brands in luxury and service apartment space, a category which has seen growing interest from major hotel chains like Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Marriott International Inc.

In an interview with Mint, Jean-Michel Cassé, chief operating officer (India and South Asia) at AccorHotels, said the company is in advanced stage of discussion with a real estate developer in Gurugram to launch its first global apartment hotel brand, Novotel Suites, in the country. Construction of the project which comprises around 100 apartments is likely to start in the next few months, he said.

The Paris-based hotel company owns and runs around 20 brands across 92 countries. In India, it currently operates around 47 hotels under 10 brands, including Sofitel, Novotel and Ibis, in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

“We are working on some projects in terms of offering serviced apartments. One or two projects are under development. We will be launching our pure standalone apartment hotel brand Novotel Suites,” Casse said. At present, the hotel company operates service apartment business under the Novotel brand in Kolkata and Visakhatpatnam and Grand Mercure in Bengaluru.

Besides the Gurugram project, the company is exploring an opportunity to launch its service apartment business in Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh.

“Up to 15% of online travellers in India are using non-hotel accommodations, including home rentals and services apartments. The demand is growing for this space. Four years back, it was about 10%. There has been also been a growing demand from corporate executives for long stay and such apartments provides a convenient option,” said Chetan Kapoor, research analyst (Asia Pacific) at Phocuswright, a travel research firm.

AccorHotels is also at an advanced stage of discussion to launch its global luxury brands Raffles Hotel and Banyan Tree, Casse said, adding that up to four hotels are likely to be launched under these brands.

“We want to develop a strong pipeline in the luxury space while we also see more opportunity to strengthen our existing brands as we get more recognition in the local market. We are aiming to open our luxury brand Raffles and also few Banyan Tree hotels in India,” he said.

At present, the company operates four luxury hotels under Sofitel, Fairmont, Pullman and Swissotel brands across Mumbai, Jaipur, New Delhi and Kolkata. It is also looking develop more Fairmont hotels in Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai, he added.

89,US shoppers and Chinese suppliers face hit from Trump levy,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/gUr0lNFSVSw4K77nOT1YvJ/US-shoppers-and-Chinese-suppliers-face-hit-from-Trump-levy.html,"Since consumer goods account for a large chunk of exports from China to the US, some Chinese manufacturers are preparing for the worst","Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected as a result of Trump tariff. Photo: Reuters

Shanghai: US President Donald Trump’s move to slap tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports is likely to be bad news for many of China’s exporters—as well as Americans who like wearing Victoria’s Secret bras, Guess jeans or Nike sneakers.

A vast amount of items used by US consumers—from Under Armour leggings to Bath & Body Works shower gel and Samsonite luggage—are sourced from Chinese or Hong Kong based companies and factories, fuelling the $450 billion in Chinese goods imported to America annually. Broad-based tariffs, which the US said would be a 25% duty, may translate into higher sticker prices in stores across the US.

Retailers in the US have pushed back, saying any such levies would amount to a tax on American consumers. In China, meanwhile, small exporters with a heavy reliance on the US worry that their cost advantage could be wiped out in the global supply chain.

“That’s it then, we have no more competitive edge,” said Justin Yu, a sales manager at Zhejiang-based Pinghu Mijia Child Product Co., which makes toy scooters sold at American retailers. “I don’t know what we are going to do.”

The US has yet to announce the list of products the additional duties will be levied on, but has said aerospace, information and communication technology will be targeted. Since consumer goods account for a large chunk of exports from China to the US, some Chinese manufacturers are preparing for the worst.

Yu said exports to the US account for over $10 million of annual revenue for Pinghu Mijia, more than half of its total sales. “Chinese manufacturing has lost its advantage now, so we might as well find some other business to do,” he said.

Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected. If tariffs are raised on its products, Samsonite International SA chief executive officer Ramesh Tainwala sees one logical recourse. “We pass it on to the consumer,” said Tainwala, who spoke to reporters in Hong Kong last week. “We have the pricing power. We are the ones who will move first and the industry will follow.”

Samsonite is in an unusual global position. While the world’s biggest luggage maker is based in Mansfield, Massachusetts, it is listed on the Hong Kong exchange. Samsonite executives say it manufactures two-thirds of its products in China and currently pays a tariff of more than 25% on them to the US.

The impact on other American companies would be widespread, fanning out across the US because of the intricate links with international supply chains. Tariffs hitting one company in China can have a ripple effect across dozens of customers in the US. The connections are particularly strong across the apparel and technology industries.

Apparel and footwear, telecommunications equipment and household appliances are among the Chinese manufacturing sectors with the biggest exposure to the US market, according to a Moody’s research note released on Thursday.

Hong Kong-based Li & Fung Ltd alone collects about two-thirds of its revenue from about 50 consumer-product companies in the US, including retailers Walmart Inc., Kohl’s Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. For Regina Miracle International Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of intimate wear, American demand for lingerie makes up about 60% of revenue. Its customers include lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.

Lenovo Group Ltd, the Beijing-based computer manufacturer, gets almost a third of its $43 billion in annual revenue from North America by selling its products to companies such as HP Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.

Shares of Li & Fung fell 10% in Hong Kong trading on Friday, their biggest drop in five years. Regina Miracle tumbled 2.3%, and Lenovo dropped 2.6%.

Still, large Chinese companies like Li & Fung are likely to get some protection because of the diversity of their businesses and their international chain of suppliers. “With a global network of over 15,000 suppliers in over 40 markets, we are well-positioned to absorb in any shock from trade uncertainty,” Li & Fung said in a statement. “We are unique in the industry, in that if there is any change in trade policy, we have the ability to channel production to any market quickly.”

Other factors may also help insulate Chinese corporations. Many are still reliant on domestic consumers for revenue, reducing their exposure in the event of a trade war. The proportion of Chinese corporate revenue that comes from overseas is an average of only 8.8%, up from 6.6% in 2012, according to research from brokerage Natixis.

Chinese tariffs

China retaliated on Friday morning with reciprocal tariffs worth $3 billion on imports of US pork, recycled aluminium, steel pipes, fruit and wine. Hong Kong-listed pork producer WH Group Ltd—which bought US-based pork giant Smithfield Foods in 2013—gets about 57% of its revenue from the US. It slid as much as 10% on Friday morning.

WH is assessing how to amend its strategy in response to the tariff, spokesman Luis Chein said. Its Smithfield operations in the US currently export to 40 other countries in addition to China. “We do not think it will have a huge impact on our US exporting business,” he said.

Closer to home in the US, smaller companies may feel the brunt of restrictive trade actions, according to Gary Huang, the Shanghai-based founder of consultancy 80/20 Sourcing. Multinationals with mature supply chains like Walmart could shift to Vietnam or India to avoid the tariffs, he said. On Amazon, more than half of product listings come from smaller businesses that source from China, which Huang said would be hit hard.

“These guys are going to be left holding the new tariff bill and those prices will go straight up,” Huang said. “This year’s Christmas could be a lot more expensive.” Bloomberg",US shoppers and Chinese suppliers face hit from Trump levy,"['hong', 'tariffs', 'suppliers', 'products', 'tariff', 'hit', 'revenue', 'trump', 'chinese', 'companies', 'china', 'prices', 'shoppers', 'face', 'trade', 'levy']","Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected as a result of Trump tariff.

Still, large Chinese companies like Li & Fung are likely to get some protection because of the diversity of their businesses and their international chain of suppliers.

Kochi: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday expressed fears that artificial intelligence (AI) would take up jobs—both high skilled and unskilled.

With advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics, this was going to change still further, as they take up the jobs,ranging from those in unskilled sweatshops to high-skilled professions like medicine, the former RBI governor said.

“What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat?Jobs that require high intelligence and creativity; jobs that require human empathy and jobs where human working for us bolster our status in some way,” he said, delivering the keynote address outlining his vision for India at #FUTURE Global Digital Summit, organised by the Kerala government.

He, however, India has to embrace technology and become a leader in the digital transformation taking place around the globe without being bogged down by unfounded fears of job losses, incomes or machines replacing humans.

Among the biggest obstacles to technology adoption were fears of man being replaced by machines — a fear that has existed since the industrial revolution,but never materialised. “Two hundred years since the industrial revolution, jobs are still around. People and society adapt to do the things that machines cannot do,” he said.

“With technology, across every job there is going to be a restructuring, taking away the routine aspects and leaving the creative and customised aspects of that job,” he said. Currently professor, finance at University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Rajan said that in every industrial country, more jobs have disappeared in routine skilled and non routine unskilled jobs, which has partly led to the anxieties.

The former RBI governor said another aspect of the fear was where the incomes would come from; the answer to which was an assured universal basic income. In the Indian context, he said, “we have a huge hunger for capabilities at every level. If we can create incomes at some level, the aspirations of people will ensure their children move up in life and get the opportunities that they did not.”

In terms of business opportunities, the government needs to do far more for start-ups to flourish in India by creating easy paths to incorporation and funding, he said. Rajan said that one of the big lacunae in India was risk financing and so start-ups go elsewhere because they need risk financing, which was not available in the country.

“We have to make sure Indian capital is available because often it is closest to the ground and understands the financing better,” Rajan said. “We have to make sure that the companies of our future are incorporated in India, get Indian financing and expand significantly. We cannot miss out on the AI and robotics revolution,” he said.

Another significant area where India effectively needs a revolution is education and skill building, Rajan said. “We need to remedy weaknesses in education at every stage, build more world-class institutions domestically and bring the talent back from abroad,” Rajan said. “We are not as global as we should be even now. Too many of our people are too poorly educated or skilled to compete in a globalised tech-enabled economy,” Rajan noted.

“If we don’t do that we will end up with a two-tier economy of a few “haves” and a vast population of “have-nots”, which is neither socially stable nor desirable,”he said.",Artificial intelligence will take up even unskilled jobs: Raghuram Rajan,"['jobs', 'machines', 'rajan', 'unskilled', 'artificial', 'india', 'job', 'rbi', 'technology', 'governor', 'financing', 'incomes', 'raghuram', 'intelligence']","Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintKochi: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday expressed fears that artificial intelligence (AI) would take up jobs—both high skilled and unskilled.

Brussels: The European Union is planning to apply tougher consumer laws to social media networks and email providers like Facebook and Google’s Gmail as scrutiny of data protection grows in the wake of an outcry over Facebook’s handling of data.

Under the draft proposal first considered last year, authorities could levy fines of at least 4% of turnover. Currently, EU consumer authorities can only levy small fines and some lack power to sanction companies at all for breaking consumer law.

It is a fresh example of tighter EU rules for technology giants following reports that a political consultancy misused the data of 50 million Facebook users in a bid to influence the 2016 US presidential election.

The proposal would extend the application of EU consumer law to “free” digital services for which consumers provide their personal data instead of paying with money, such as cloud storage services, social media and email accounts.

“Given the increasing economic value of personal data, those services are not simply ‘free’”, said the document seen by Reuters and due to be presented next month.

The proposal would give consumers the right to pre-contractual information and to cancel contracts within 14 days.

It would also require member states to ensure that their national consumer authorities can levy fines of at least 4% of annual turnover, in line with those foreseen under an EU data protection law set to enter into force in May.

The European Commission is also planning a new law regulating the commercial practices of online platforms with smaller businesses, seeking to curtail their huge market power.

EU consumer authorities have been pressing Facebook, Twitter and Google to improve their user terms since last year. While Google’s changes were deemed sufficient, those of Facebook and Twitter only partially addressed the authorities’ concerns. No enforcement action has been taken so far.

The proposal, if agreed by the European Parliament and member states, would also give consumer authorities more teeth to deal with scandals such as Dieselgate, where German carmaker Volkswagen cheated emissions tests.

The Dutch regulator fined Volkswagen €450,000 ($554,085.00) for misleading consumers who bought its diesel cars, the maximum fine possible.

By contrast, VW has pledged billions of dollars to compensate owners of its diesel cars in the United States.

“The available penalties for infringements of consumer law are very different across the EU, and are often set at a low level,” the document says.

“As a result, their deterrence in some countries is also low.” Reuters","EU plans tougher consumer laws for Facebook, Gmail","['proposal', 'data', 'authorities', 'law', 'plans', 'facebook', 'services', 'planning', 'tougher', 'gmail', 'consumer', 'laws', 'european', 'eu']","Photo: ReutersBrussels: The European Union is planning to apply tougher consumer laws to social media networks and email providers like Facebook and Google’s Gmail as scrutiny of data protection grows in the wake of an outcry over Facebook’s handling of data.

Moscow/Geneva: Russia will likely prepare a list of restrictions on imported products from the United States in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, Moscow’s trade ministry said on Friday, according to Interfax news agency.

The announcement came after China threatened to retaliate to US President Donald Trump’s measures, stoking fears of a looming global trade war.

“We will prepare our position, submit it to the Economy Ministry and apply to the WTO (the World Trade Organization),” Russia’s deputy trade minister, Viktor Yevtukhov, said, according to Interfax.

“We will probably prepare proposals on the response measures. Restrictions against the American goods. I think that all countries will follow this path,” Yevtukhov added.

The United States has said the tariffs are needed to protect its national security and therefore do not need to be cleared by the WTO. Many trade experts disagree saying they fall under the jurisdiction of the Geneva-based global trade body.

Russian steel and aluminium producers have been playing down the potential impact of the US tariffs. But Russia’s trade ministry said there would be an impact.

Russian steel and aluminium producers may lose $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from the US tariffs introduction, Yevtukhov said, citing preliminary estimates for the trade ministry. It was not clear whether he was referring to annual losses.

China’s commerce ministry said on Friday that the country was planning measures against up to $3 billion of US imports to balance the steel and aluminium tariffs, with a list of 128 US products that could be targeted.

New Delhi: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday disposed of a case against Kokila Dhirubhai Ambani related to alleged violation of disclosure norms with regard to share transactions in three Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group firms.

The firms are Reliance Capital, Reliance Communications and Reliance Power and Kokila Ambani is a promoter in all of them. A department of the Sebi had carried out inspection of the books of accounts and other records of Reliance Capital Asset Management pertaining to its operations as a portfolio manager.

During the inspection, it was observed that certain shares of Reliance Capital, Reliance Communications and Reliance Power were lying in the client account of Kokila Ambani. Afterwards, it was noted that through various transactions in 2006 and 2008 in all the three companies, the number of shares held by her through her portfolio account had crossed 25,000.

Also, the shareholding was allegedly not disclosed to the respective companies and stock exchanges as prescribed under Regulation 13(4A) and 13(5) of the PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations. Regulation 13(4A) requires necessary disclosures to be made by any person who is promoter or part of promoter group if there is a change in shareholding exceeding 25,000 shares, among others.

Regulation 13(5) stipulates the disclosures to be made within two working days. In an order, Sebi noted that the alleged transactions pertain to 2006 and 2008 and the alleged due dates for compliance with the disclosure requirements for those transactions pertain to 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

As per the regulator, Regulation 13(4A) and consequential amendment to Regulation 13(5) came into effect from August 16, 2011 and did not exist on the date of alleged transactions or the alleged due dates for compliance.

“I also do not find any provision in the said amendment for the retrospective effect of the said amended provisions. Since the dates of transactions/ due dates for compliances alleged in the matter precede the coming into force of the regulatory provisions alleged to have been violated by more than two years, the said regulatory provisions are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant matter,” Sebi said.

Accordingly, Sebi concluded that the allegation of violation of Regulation 13(4A) and 13(5) of the PIT Regulations against Kokila Dhirubhai Ambani “is not tenable” and disposed of the matter.

Moscow: Messaging service Telegram Group Inc., which smashed the world record for selling a new cryptocurrency in February, is on track to raise another $850 million as its initial coin offering (ICO) extends toward a third month, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Investors are placing sufficient orders in the second round even after the token was priced at more than triple last month’s level, two of the people said, asking not to be identified as the offer is private. Appetite for crypto-assets has cooled somewhat since market leader bitcoin failed to return to its January highs, they explained.

The comments signal that the ICO is going mostly according to plan for Pavel Durov, the self-exiled Russian entrepreneur who founded the encrypted-chat app with his mathematician brother Nikolai in 2013 and now boasts 200 million users from Iran to Brazil.

The firm, registered in the British Virgin Islands, is finding enough interest among a global pool of investors who have been rocked by a volatile token market and whose sceptics say they doubt the Durovs can meet their goal to speed transactions processing toward a level of Visa or Mastercard.

Telegram raised $850 million from large investors last month, selling rights to virtual coins called Grams at $0.38 apiece, according to a filing. The second round is targeting another $850 million at $1.33 apiece this month, according to the company documents seen by Bloomberg News. Telegram didn’t respond to Bloomberg inquiries seeking comment.

The company is seeking to build is own blockchain network with Gram built-in, enabling much faster transactions speed than rival networks run for bitcoin and ethereum. It’s raising funds to build this network, rent servers, boost the number of users and pay operating expenses, the documents say.

Demand in the ICO’s second round is lower than for the first, and some investors were given extra time to produce the funds, two of the people said.

Photo: Reuters

San Francisco: Apple Inc. is preparing to introduce new low-cost iPads and education software next week in a bid to win back students and teachers from Google and Microsoft Corp.

In its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It’s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.

In Chicago, the world’s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.

Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.

Apple accounted for 17% of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google’s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60% of the market, and Windows PCs had 22%. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20% of Apple’s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.

A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won’t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn’t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.

Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.

With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That’s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7% in 2017. Apple grew 3% last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.

Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company’s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There’s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.

More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that’s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it’s unclear if it’ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.

In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce “creative new ideas for teachers and students.” Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.

Next week’s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it’s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city’s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.

According to Apple’s website, the school where the event will take place is not an “Apple Distinguished School,” a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.

Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.

Such a deal won’t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a Rs1,394.43 crore bank fraud case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure Ltd on a complaint by state-run Union Bank of India.

“The CBI registered a case today (Thursday) on a complaint by Union Bank of India against Totem Infrastructure and its promoters and directors Tottempudi Salalith and his wife Tottempudi Kavita of Hyderabad,” a person familiar with the developments said.

The number of bank fraud cases has been piling up after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks to file complaints against erring companies. The latest case comes just a day after the investigating agency filed a case of loan fraud against Kanishk Gold Pvt. Ltd on a complaint by State Bank of India (SBI).

Union Bank of India’s industrial finance branch of Hyderabad filed the complaint against Totem for cheating the bank to an extent of Rs313.84 crore.

“Totem Infrastructure took a loan from a consortium of eight banks, including Union Bank, wherein the total outstanding dues stand at Rs1,394.43 crore. This account became NPA (non-performing asset) on 30 June 2012,” the person added.

The agency said that Union Bank of India had only recently filed a complaint with the agency against Totem Infrastructure.

It was alleged in the complaint by Union Bank that “the company had diverted funds by opening accounts outside the consortium and through payments of wages by showing excess expenditure and inflated stocks. The entire sale proceeds were not allegedly routed through the dealing branches of consortium banks.”

Union Bank of India declined to comment on the matter.

CBI said that it had tracked the promoters down and “have located the accused at a new place of residence and searches are underway”.

Other persons familiar with the case also confirmed that Totem Infrastructure was engaged in infrastructure projects, wherein “they took subcontracts from Larsen and Toubro Ltd, Ircon International Ltd and similar companies.”

In a statement, CBI added that “the said private company (Totem) based at Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was in the business of EPC (engineering procurement and construction) contractor engaged in road projects, water works, building structures and also undertook works as a sub contractor to various companies.”

Totem Infrastructure did not respond to Mint’s calls or messages.

On Wednesday, CBI registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain for allegedly defrauding State Bank of India (SBI) and 13 other banks to the tune of Rs824.15 crore, while also issuing lookout circulars against the accused.

“The CBI, on Thursday, conducted two fresh searches (locations not disclosed) and questioned Bhoopesh Jain and Neeta Jain in connection with the case and lookout circulars have been issued against those who have been accused,” the person cited above added.

Lookout circulars are issued by the CBI against the accused in a case, so that they cannot flee the country.

Other than Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain, the CBI also booked Tejraj Achha, a partner at Achha Associates; Ajay Kumar Jain, a partner in Ajay and Co.; Sumit Kedia who is a partner at Lunawath and Associates.

While emails and calls to SBI remained unanswered, Kanishk Gold did not respond to calls either.

Both the scams have come in the wake of the Rs12,636 crore PNB fraud case, where the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have filed cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, respectively. However, both Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi have declined to join the investigation.

101,How 2 disruptions are reshaping India’s automobile industry,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/gOciF8rbcWgab8685YFytL/How-2-disruptions-are-reshaping-Indias-automobile-industry.html,"For India’s automobile industry, the twin hurdles of electric vehicles and stricter emission norms are closer than they appear. A look at how it is coping with these sector-defining challenges","New Delhi: For India’s top carmakers, it’s the best of times and the worst of times.

2017 has been a blockbuster year for the country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Its models took the top five spots in sales for the first time in a decade. Its market share has risen to 51%, the highest in 10 years. And from all available evidence, 2018 may be even better.

That’s the good news.

The bad news is that things could change quickly, and the recent history of business is littered with examples of how quickly the tide can turn.

This time, India’s top carmakers could be at the short end of the stick, and they know it. What lies ahead is a long and hard struggle as multiple disruptive forces reshape the market.

The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles

Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Maruti Suzuki, under whom the carmaker has stamped its complete dominance over the Indian market, says the company may have to re-invent itself and “start again from zero”.

There are reasons to be wary.

The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles.

That’s not all.

Alongside is a more near-term worry. Carmakers have been asked by the government, keen to reduce pollution, to leap-frog from the current BS-IV emission norms to the much stricter BS-VI by April 2020, skipping an intermediate level.

While success is not guaranteed, Maruti Suzuki is pulling out all stops to make sure that it’s not left behind.

“We are trying to challenge ourselves as time has come to change the game. Hence, we have to review (our strategy) and start again from zero,” Ayukawa says in an interview.

The coming events, automobile analysts say, will allow Maruti Suzuki’s rivals to play catch-up with the market leader.

The dynamics of the Indian automobile market are set to undergo a sea change as global automobile giants such as Renault SA, Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. will use their expertise in electric vehicles (EVs) to undermine current leaders.

“The industry dynamics will change and the players that are leaders today... will not necessarily remain leaders after the electric vehicle dust settles down,” Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, said in an interview.

Mahindra is the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the country and the first auto maker to invest in electric technology in India, giving it an edge over rivals.

“New players who are either non-existent or are small players today could become leaders after the dust settles down,” Goenka said.

Carmakers, at least those that are least prepared for an electric future, have got a breather with the government saying that it won’t announce an Indian EV policy exclusively for electric vehicles, in an U-turn from its earlier position, and instead support all kinds of sustainable mobility solutions.

The industry dynamics will change and the players that are leaders today... will not necessarily remain leaders after the electric vehicle dust settles down- Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra

“There is no need for any policy now,” Nitin Gadkari, minister for road transport, said at a press briefing on 16 February. (read more)

This is a remarkable volte-face, given that as recently as in January, Gadkari had said the policy was awaiting approval from the Union cabinet.

He had earlier outlined the government’s ambitious plan to shift to electric vehicles by 2030.

On 12 March, Mint reported that the government’s think-tank NITI Aayog has tasked at least seven government ministries with framing guidelines to encourage the use of electric vehicles.

Once framed, NITI Aayog will put these guidelines together as an action plan for promoting the use of electric vehicles, four people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.

Notwithstanding the EV policy uncertainty, companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp. are preparing for a time when the now ubiquitous internal combustion engine-run cars become a relic of history.

Suzuki Motor Corp., the parent of Maruti Suzuki, is collaborating with Toyota to make small and affordable electric cars in India.

For Suzuki, protecting its turf in India is linked to its own survival as half of its revenue comes from the Indian unit.

Toyota Motor Corp., on the other hand, has invested heavily in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell-driven vehicles globally instead of electric. It would have had the most to lose if the government encouraged solely electric vehicles.

Still, the company has started to develop electric vehicles in China and has also formed a joint venture with Mazda Technologies Ltd and Denso Corp. Ltd in Japan for developing the requisite technologies for electric vehicles.

The electric vehicles wave will probably hit the Indian shores a few years later than earlier estimated, but another disruption is already keeping Indian automobile makers on their toes.

In 2016, the Union government decided to skip the Bharat Stage-V (BS-V) emission norms and brought forward the date of implementation of the BS-VI emission norms by two years to 1 April 2020, an unprecedented move in the global automotive space.

As a consequence, carmakers had to earmark substantial amounts to upgrade their existing products to meet emission norms at a time when the economy was rattled by policy decisions such as demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST).

Two of the country’s biggest two-wheeler makers—Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd and Royal Enfield—have already announced that they will not launch any new products till 2020. Honda two-wheelers’ (HMSI) plan to establish its fifth manufacturing plant has been frozen despite the company’s factories operating at almost full capacity.

Underscoring the enormity of the task at hand, Minoru Kato, president and chief executive of HMSI, said, “We are considering a fifth manufacturing unit but adhering to BS-VI emission norms by 2020 is the biggest concern. Not only Honda, other manufacturers will also have to comply with the norms. So production cost will increase. Hence, we need to increase price as well. So, the total motorcycle industry sales will decrease in 2020.”

In November 2017, Siddhartha Lal, managing director of Eicher Motor Ltd (which owns Royal Enfield), said the company will not launch any new models in the next two years and the next new offerings will be just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in.

Car launches have also come down by half over the past four years as automobile manufacturers struggle to adapt to rapidly changing regulations, industry executives said.

There were 12 model launches in 2015. That plunged to five each in 2016 and 2017, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

The lacklustre Delhi Auto Expo 2018 in February is a testament of the apprehension among auto makers.

An updated Maruti Suzuki Swift was the only vehicle to be unveiled on the second day of the show, unprecedented in the history of South Asia’s biggest auto show.

Most manufacturers, including Volkswagen group, Ford India Pvt. Ltd, Nissan India Pvt. Ltd and Jaguar and Land Rover India, did not participate in the biennial show.

The ones that participated, such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor, also did not showcase any new models that would be launched over the next year-and-a-half.

For Pratap Bose, head of designing at Tata Motors Ltd, complying with the new emissions norms is never a challenge, but “timelines should not shift and move as the challenge is to plan to a particular date”.

The updated Maruti Suzuki Swift was the only vehicle to be unveiled on the second day of the Delhi Auto Expo 2018.

The automobile industry, contrary to the decision made by the government on electric vehicles, was looking for a direction in which the government wants them to move before investing billions of dollars in electric mobility.

“We need a clear picture from the government, but we cannot wait. Still, we are waiting for a detailed road map to be proposed and developed by the NITI Aayog,” said Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive officer, Hyundai Motor India in an interview.

Ford India Pvt. Ltd’s managing director Anurag Mehrotra concurred with his Hyundai counterpart and said, “Till such time we have a policy framework, it’s a little difficult. It is like shooting in the dark. So you have to be careful that you get your policy and once it is done, we will be able to come back.”

According to Puneet Gupta, associate director at global automotive sales forecasting firm, IHS Markit, China has already announced the electric vehicles policy last year. This has helped all Chinese and global vehicle makers, and they have started working on electric cars in China on a war footing.

“We need a clear picture from the government (on electric vehicles), but we cannot wait. Still, we are waiting for a detailed road map to be proposed and developed by the NITI Aayog- Y.K. Koo, managing director of Hyundai Motor India

Maruti Suzuki, though, did not wait for the government to formulate an India EV policy before taking crucial business decisions pertaining to electric vehicles.

For instance, the company has already announced that it will launch its first electric vehicle in 2020. Besides that, the company will also set up its own charging station for potential customers as the lack of charging stations is one of the biggest impediments facing the industry. It has also started to conduct a survey on customer expectations from electric vehicles.

To be sure, this is not the first time that Maruti Suzuki is faced with a big challenge.

In 2011-12, when diesel car sales started to increase at a brisk pace, the company was found wanting.

Rivals Mahindra and Mahindra and Hyundai Motor chipped away at its market share, until it touched a low of 42% during the year; but the company took a swift decision to buy diesel engines from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and over the next five years, the company steadily regained share with new models.

This time, the company has tied up with Toyota Motor Corp. and will set up its own lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat way ahead of other manufacturers.

Two other embattled passenger vehicle manufacturers—Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors—have also been investing heavily in the development of electric vehicles.

“We think in India also, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have made up their mind to invest in electric car and technology, but more clarity on electric policy can lead to ideas translating into business, which means more jobs and more revenues for the Indian automobile industry,” added Gupta of IHS Markit.

According to a senior industry executive, the automobile industry is extremely resilient, whatever the adversity, and has managed to emerge stronger over the years.

As of now, there are too many impediments on the road to the successful adoption of electric vehicles in India.

The availability of charging stations and sourcing of lithium are probably the two major roadblocks that need to be overcome.

Recently, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL)—a public sector unit under the ministry of power—had to defer the date of taking delivery of electric vehicles from Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra due to the lack of charging infrastructure.

Also, once the BS-VI emission norms come into effect on 6 April 2020, manufacturers and suppliers would need at least five years to get a return on the equity.

The vehicle manufacturers would also need to set up an alternative ecosystem, as mentioned by the Ayukawa, in the next decade or so in order to engineer a smooth transformation to electric vehicles.

“We have to develop the electric vehicle first and compete in the market. As manufacturers, what we can do is to supply good vehicles to the market. That is the only way. Without a product, we cannot do anything,” opined Ayukawa.",How 2 disruptions are reshaping India’s automobile industry,"['indias', 'disruptions', 'industry', 'reshaping', 'india', 'electric', 'suzuki', 'automobile', 'vehicles', 'norms', 'vehicle', 'motor', 'policy', 'maruti']","The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles.

102,"Sun Pharma: One down, Halol to go",https://www.livemint.com/Money/KxjgAuVOgB7V65AVzhZpPI/Sun-Pharma-One-down-Halol-to-go.html,"Sun Pharma has passed a key milestone with the Ilumya drug approval, but its investors seem to be fixated on its ability to get the USFDA approval for the Halol plant","Sun Pharma has fared worse compared to its peers and the broad market. Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

In every conference call held in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s quarterly result, the launch of tildrakizumab was a key point discussed. The Halol plant’s non-compliant regulatory status was another. It’s a bit of a surprise then that its shares yawned at the announcement that the firm got a novel drug approval for Ilumya, the brand name for tildrakizumab.

This could be a case of the news already in the price but this was by no means a slam dunk, as seen from the conversations in these calls.

There is the possibility that the company’s continuously flagging US sales growth and inability to clear the Halol hurdle has made investors circumspect, even in the face of positive news. At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

Ilumya is good news in that light, becoming a key contributor to US revenues eventually. This drug was licensed by Sun Pharma from Merck and Co. in 2014, by paying an initial sum of $80 million and while Merck did the work and filings to bring it to market, Sun Pharma has borne all costs.

It has worldwide rights for this product and has out-licensed it for Europe. Sun Pharma will pay Merck milestone-related amounts (the approval itself will trigger a payment) and then royalty on sales that will range from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.

Sun Pharma deserves a pat for getting its licensing candidate right, which targets a large market opportunity. In recent calls, Sun Pharma’s management has said its marketing organization for Ilumya is in place, and some field force recruitments are already done. That means related investments and expenses, to an extent, are already in its expenditure.

Initially, Merck will supply the product and later Sun Pharma will shift production to a third-party facility. Sun Pharma’s management had said that the investment phase for Ilumya—where the company will spend more than it will sell—may last for 1.5-2 years.

In the US, the market for psoriasis drugs is a sizeable one. For instance, Janssen Biotech Inc.’s Stelara earned $4 billion in global revenues in 2017. Janssen also launched a product Tremfya, which is in the same sub-category of IL-23 products, as Sun Pharma’s Ilumya. There are some concerns too, on whether too many products are crowding this market, whether Tremfya will be preferred over llumya, and also positive trial data for a new product risankizumab (being developed by AbbVie Inc.).

In response to a question that asked the revenue potential from speciality products, Sun Pharma’s managing director Dilip Shanghvi said that IL-23 and IL-17 (different sub-categories of immunology products targeting diseases such as psoriasis) are being sold by very large companies with more experience in speciality biologics than Sun Pharma. While the company may not have the same success the large firms may have (in turning it into a blockbuster drug), Shanghvi said it has a good product and sees no reason to not try and match those revenues. He also clarified that the current spend is not geared to handle that kind of volume and upside but Sun Pharma will take that decision closer to market.

After its March quarter results, the management will give a guidance for FY19, which should factor in the impact of Ilumya’s launch. Sun Pharma will probably share some details on its plans for the product and its future. Investors are keeping their hopes low. Whether they are surprised by the management’s guidance remains to be seen. The company has passed a key near-term milestone with the Ilumya approval. Sun Pharma’s investors seem to be fixated more on its ability to get the Halol facility compliant for them to change their cautious view.","Sun Pharma: One down, Halol to go","['products', 'pharmas', 'merck', 'pharma', 'halol', 'management', 'product', 'revenues', 'ilumya', 'market']","At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017.

Of course, it is certain that Mahindra has not given up the battle. In a recent Investor Day presentation at Mahindra Research Valley, the senior management focused on the auto business. The host of launches lined up in the UV segment in the coming months indicates that the company hopes to stage a comeback and regain its lost market share. But this is easier said than done.

Note that when Maruti Suzuki was steadily conquering the UV market by tweaking its range and launching relatively cheaper compact UVs, such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis, Mahindra was caught napping. Lack of products in the compact segment was its biggest failure. And now, the road ahead is arduous and rife with competition. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. is a strong competitor with deep pockets. It has garnered nearly a fifth of the UV market in just two years. There is also Toyota Motor Corp. that is keen on expanding its presence in the Indian market from the present 12%.

Therefore, Mahindra’s struggle would be far greater than what it was seven years ago, when it was the market supremo. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “If Mahindra is targeting a market share of 30% in UVs, it appears achievable.” That said, it is highly unlikely that the company will regain its stronghold with a 50%-plus market share in UVs.

Add to this, the costs of advertising and marketing to keep abreast of competition especially from Maruti Suzuki—whose reach is relatively greater—might dent profitability unless the new launches rake in strong sales volume. As such, the share of its auto division in the overall Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) has declined from two-thirds to one-third, ever since it lost ground in UVs. Profit margins have ebbed too.

Thankfully, Mahindra’s farm equipment division’s stellar growth rate over the last two years on the back of a favourable monsoon and a growing rural economy, has partially offset the pain in the auto division.

From an investor standpoint therefore, FY19 would be the make or break year for the auto segment. With Maruti Suzuki being a strong force to contend with and in the lead position, it is a tough road ahead for Mahindra.

This explains why Mahindra’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has been sticky at around 17, in spite of two strong growth years for the farm equipment division.",Mahindra on rough terrain as Maruti Suzuki grabs No. 1 slot in utility vehicles,"['market', 'auto', 'terrain', 'utility', 'suzuki', 'vehicles', 'grabs', 'strong', 'slot', 'share', 'mahindra', 'uv', 'rough', 'segment', 'uvs', 'maruti']","Maruti Suzuki has steadily captured the utility vehicle market from Mahindra by tweaking its range and launching compact UVs such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis.

With a year left for the next general elections, Modi and his government find themselves under fire from opponents for what they perceive to be a failure to live up to that promise.

The debate on job creation in the country has been handicapped because of lack of regular and credible data. While several new job surveys are currently underway, and their results will likely be known a few months down the line, they are not likely to be comparable to previous surveys because of methodological differences.

One way to examine trends in job growth is to look at corporate and industrial data to figure out how many employees companies and industrial units are recruiting. A Mint analysis of corporate data sourced from the ProwessIQ database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) suggests that while corporations have been creating new jobs, the pace of job creation has been lacklustre over the past few years.

The ProwessIQ database consists of records of over 27,000 Indian firms (listed and unlisted) but the number of firms for which employee data is available over the past few years is very small. To get around this problem, we consider a two-year rolling sample of firms for which records are available for two successive years. The average sample size for the past decade, based on this methodology, is 1,360 firms. For the latest year— fiscal year 2017 (FY17)—our sample includes more than 2,000 firms, which collectively employ nearly 6.4 million employees.

The data shows that corporate jobs grew at an average annual pace of 4% between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2009. The shock of the global financial crisis led to a sharp slowdown, with job growth slowing to 2% in fiscal year 2010 before recovering sharply to grow at 5% in fiscal year 2011. However that recovery, much like the recovery in India’s economic engine, was short-lived. The pace of job creation was less than 1% in fiscal year 2013 and a little above 1.5% in fiscal year 2014. Fiscal year 2015 actually saw a contraction in jobs, after which there has been a slow recovery. However, the pace of job creation over the past couple of years—at roughly 2% per annum—is significantly lower than the pace of job creation in the 2006-11 phase.

Surprisingly, it is smaller firms that are adding jobs at a faster pace compared to bigger ones. Dividing the overall sample of corporations into four quartiles based on net sales, we find that firms with the smallest sales (bottom quartile) have been adding jobs at a faster clip than firms with the largest sales.

The overall trend in corporate jobs broadly mirrors the trends in employee growth reported by the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), which covers a much larger sample of firms but excludes services altogether from its coverage. The ASI data on employees is more volatile compared to the Prowess data, and is available only till fiscal year 2016 but they point to the same long-run trends. The only sector where organized jobs seem to be growing is the public sector, as an analysis by howindialives.com published in Mint showed.

The data from Prowess does not tell us much about the nature of jobs being added: whether it is regular or contractual jobs which are being added. But data from ASI, which provides that bifurcation, shows that the reliance on contractual workers has grown over the past few years.

This suggests that of the jobs being created, many may be of a temporary nature without the benefits that regular employees enjoy. Independent household surveys also show that most salaried workers in India are insecure, lacking written contracts or benefits such as provident fund and maternity leave. The ICE 360° survey conducted in 2016 showed that 68% of salaried workers in rural India, and 71% of salaried workers in urban India lacked even a written contract.

The 2017 report of a task force on improving India’s employment statistics headed by former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended that the government should consider even jobs without written contracts as formal jobs as long as those employed in such jobs are covered by either provident fund or insurance schemes (public or private). Such alternative definitions of formal employment may provide an artificial boost to India’s official employment numbers. But generating adequate numbers of high quality jobs will require greater imagination and effort.

Los Angeles: YouTube will increase the number of ads that some users see between music videos, part of a strategy to convince more of its billion-plus viewers to pay for a forthcoming subscription music service from the Google-owned video site.

People who treat YouTube like a music service, those passively listening for long periods of time, will encounter more ads, according to Lyor Cohen, the company’s global head of music. “You’re not going to be happy after you are jamming Stairway to Heaven and you get an ad right after that,” Cohen said in an interview at the South by Southwest music festival.

Cohen is trying to prove that YouTube is committed to making people pay for music and silence the “noise” about his company’s purported harm to the recording industry. The labels companies have long criticized YouTube for hosting videos that violate copyrights, and not paying artists and record companies enough.

YouTube will provide a necessary counterweight to the growing influence of Spotify Technology SA and Apple Inc., which own the leading online music services and generate significant revenue for the industry, Cohen said. YouTube generated an estimated $10 billion in revenue last year, almost all from advertising, and could make even more if it sells subscriptions.

YouTube has tried to sell its users paid music services in the past, with little to show for it. Most of those efforts predate Cohen, who joined YouTube in 2016 after about 30 years in the record business, including stints as a road manager for Run-DMC and a senior executive at Warner Music Group.

This time will be different, Cohen says. The new service, which is already being used by thousands of Google employees, will “frustrate and seduce” users of YouTube’s free service. It will include exclusive videos, playlists and other offerings that will appeal to die-hard music fans. YouTube has already been funding the production of videos, taking fans behind-the-scenes with artists like rapper G-Eazy and Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello.

The new approach marks a big cultural shift for YouTube and its parent. Google, a division of Alphabet Inc., has sustained the most popular video site and search engine in the world by prioritizing free, easy-to-use services.

Cohen said he prevailed upon his colleagues and bosses to make some changes to “be good partners” to the music industry. They will “smoke out” people who can afford to pay for a subscription and shepherd them to the new service.

“There’s a lot more people in our funnel that we can frustrate and seduce to become subscribers,” Cohen said. “Once we do that, trust me, all that noise will be gone and articles people write about that noise will be gone.”

New Delhi: In an attempt to boost domestic cooking gas consumption under the marque Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), or Ujjwala scheme, state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Friday announced deferment of loan recovery up to six refills.

Under the Ujjwala scheme—a key welfare programme of the centre for poor women—many availing an equated monthly instalment (EMI) facility for meeting the cost of stove and first refills were paying market price for refills till the loan repayment was made.

This was resulting in some consumers becoming averse to such refills.

“As per the data available, about 70% of the PMUY customers have availed interest-free loan facility provided by OMCs towards financing LPG stove and/or first LPG cost. Under the scheme, OMCs are recovering the subsidy amount provided on subsequent refills from beneficiaries who have taken loan and adjusting the same towards the repayment of the loan,” state-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd said in a statement on Friday.

PMUY, launched in 2016, aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with LPG, so that they are protected from smoke while cooking or from having to go into unsafe areas to collect firewood.

“Hence, 70% Ujjwala beneficiaries purchase refills at market price until their loan is paid back. Paying the market price for the initial few refills is an additional hurdle that was coming in the way of their shift towards cleaner fuel, resulting in periodic slips back to biomass,” the statement added.

Under the scheme, the government aims to provide cooking gas to poor households and has covered 713 districts.

The scheme aims to replace cooking fuels, used mostly in rural India, with clean liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

Ujjwala scheme provides financial support of Rs1,600 for each cooking gas connection to eligible households. The connections are given in the name of the women heads of the households.

“Keeping in line with the spirit of PMUY scheme and the country’s goal to achieving universal LPG penetration by 2022 , OMCs have announced today to defer recovery of loan amount from Ujjwala beneficiaries for next six refills starting from 1 April 2018,” the statement said.

The importance of the LPG programme is evident from the fact that Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his 2018-19 Union Budget expanded the scope of Ujjwala to 80 million women, from 50 million earlier. So far, over 35.11 million women have been given connections under the scheme.

“Amount transferred under various Direct Benefits Transfer schemes increased by 25 times since the Modi Govt took over. #PAHAL, the largest DBT scheme in the world run by @PetroleumMin is the largest contributor,” oil and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted on Friday.

The scheme has been gaining traction. Mint reported on 6 Match about increased use of cooking gas may shrink the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in India, based on the statistics from the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) on TB prevalence. The NFHS-4 (2015-16) showed a great variation of TB prevalence in accordance with the type of cooking fuel used at home. TB was more common in homes using solid cooking fuels than using clean fuels.

With more people dieing of TB in India than any other country, India has been facing the problem of untimely deaths to unclean cooking fuels.

“Getting an LPG connection is a onetime decision; getting a refill is a decision that is to be made afresh every month or so taking into account several factors including any emergency expenditure that the family needs to prioritise. The first year of using LPG is crucial in a household’s journey from unclean to clean cooking fuel,” the statement added.","Ujjawala scheme: Indian Oil, others defer loan recovery up to 6 LPG refills","['lpg', 'recovery', 'indian', 'loan', 'cooking', 'refills', 'oil', 'gas', 'defer', 'ujjawala', 'scheme', 'statement', 'ujjwala', 'tb', 'women']","Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: In an attempt to boost domestic cooking gas consumption under the marque Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), or Ujjwala scheme, state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Friday announced deferment of loan recovery up to six refills.

New Delhi: A draft defence production policy put out by the government proposes to increase the foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in niche technology areas to 74% under the automatic route, in a bid to boost local manufacturing and catapult India into the league of countries housing top defence and aerospace industries.

At present, the FDI cap for the defence sector is 49% under the automatic route for all categories.

The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018, which was made public late on Thursday, aims to “create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative”.

It also aims to “facilitate faster absorption of technology and create a tiered defence industrial ecosystem in the country”, besides reducing the “dependence on imports” to “achieve self-reliance”.

India is currently the top importer of defence hardware in the world (according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been running a campaign with the goal of increasing the share of local manufacturing in the defence sector to create more jobs.

“It’s a bit ambitious in scope. The targets set will be very difficult to realize in their entirety,” said C. Uday Bhaskar, a former navy commodore and currently director of Delhi-based think tank Society for Policy Studies.

According to the policy, India hopes to achieve a turnover of Rs1.7 trillion in defence goods and services by 2025. It has a goal of becoming an arms exporter to the tune of Rs35,000 crore in defence goods and services by 2025.

By giving a leg-up to defence manufacturing, Asia’s third largest economy also hopes to transform itself into a “global leader in cyberspace and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies”.

The government is targeting achieving self-reliance in the development and manufacture of fighter aircraft, medium-lift and utility helicopters, warships, land combat vehicles, autonomous weapon systems, missiles, guns, small arms, ammunition, explosives, surveillance, electronic warfare and communication systems and night fighting equipment.

To achieve all these goals and to make it easier to do business in the area of defence for innovators, small- and medium-sized enterprises, the policy proposes to bring in enabling provisions to ensure start-ups and small enterprises participate “without having restrictions of turnover” or “prior experience”.

The government will list its requirements in terms of platforms and weapon systems for the next decade to help private sector companies understand the opportunities.

It will also simplify procedures for private firms to enter defence production, i.e., liberalize the regime by issuing licences in 30 days and pruning no-go areas to a small ‘negative list’ for licensing.

The government will also do away with capacity assessment, except for critical projects. It will introduce earnest money deposits and performance guarantees as safeguards for others.

With regard to offsets, the government has proposed to set up an ombudsman for resolving all such claims. Offsets—investments through a local partner to set up an ecosystem of suppliers—would be investment linked.

In the area of taxation, the government has proposed rationalization of taxes on import of capital goods for services and inputs for defence and aims to prevent inversion of taxes.",Draft defence production policy aims to raise FDI cap in niche tech to 74%,"['raise', 'production', 'draft', 'create', 'tech', 'fdi', 'aims', 'defence', 'india', 'small', 'services', 'systems', 'set', 'niche', 'cap', 'policy']","The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018 aims to ‘create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative’.

New Delhi: E-commerce platform ShopClues on Sunday said its revenues have grown by 60% this fiscal, while losses have been trimmed by almost 40% compared to the previous year as it focusses on growing business from categories like fashion and strengthening position in tier III cities and beyond.

The Gurgaon-based company, which competes with the likes of Flipkart and Amazon, is also confident of hitting profits in the next 12-18 months. Speaking to PTI, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Sanjay Sethi said the 2017 was spent ensuring that the company has the “right revenue margins” without any discounting or heavy spending on warehousing adding to its costs.

“2018 will be about continuing the growth. We became unit economic positive across all categories last year and we are looking at hitting profits in the coming fiscal,” he said. Sethi declined to comment on topline and bottomline numbers as these numbers are still being audited, Sethi said revenues have grown about 60%, while losses have come down by about 40%.

According to documents filed by the company with the corporate affairs ministry, ShopClues’ revenue from operations was at Rs180.3 crore in 2016-17, against Rs161.4 crore in the preceding fiscal. Its losses were also lower at Rs332.65 crore for the year ended March 2017 compared to a loss of Rs383.05 crore in 2015-16.

“We are like the ‘bazaar’. Our customers are cost-conscious. They are definitely ambitious and want the big brands but a significant part of their purchases is still done through places like local markets,” Sethi explained.

He added that about 80 % of the company’s orders come from tier III cities and beyond from places like Haflong, Palai, Chatrapur etc and that these customers are also buying more frequently—20% more as compared to those in metros.

Asked about competition against heavyweights like Flipkart and Amazon, ShopClues co-founder and chief business officer Radhika Ghai said there is enough room in the market for multiple players to grow. “Everyone thought shopping malls will kill big markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi. But that hasn’t happened. People throng both of these locations and are buying. Same is the case with us and our competitors,” she said.

Ghai added that the company has till date raised about $200 million and on track to hit profits, which shows that its “business model is working well”. She pointed that the e-commerce market in India is underpenetrated at about 2% of the multi-billion dollar retail industry in India and there is room for all the players to grow their business.","ShopClues sees 60% revenue growth, eyes profits in 12-18 months","['1218', 'eyes', 'company', 'business', 'profits', 'shopclues', '60', 'grown', 'fiscal', 'sees', 'revenue', 'crore', 'months', 'losses', 'sethi', 'revenues', 'growth']","A file photo of ShopClues CEO Sanjay Sethi who says revenues have grown by about 60% while losses have come down by about 40%.

New Delhi: Former NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya has made a strong case for privatisation of public sector banks with the exception of State Bank of India, saying that political parties serious of forming government in 2019 should include the proposal in their manifesto.

Panagariya, who is currently a professor of economics at Columbia University, said predominance of scandals and non-performing assets in PSU banks are important reasons for bank privatisation.

“I firmly believe that privatisation of all public sector banks, except perhaps the State Bank of India, should be on the election manifestos of all parties who wish to present themselves as serious candidates to form the government in 2019,” Panagariya said when asked about the recent banking frauds, including the one at Punjab National Bank (PNB).

The economist further argued that efficiency and productivity demand that the government relinquish its control of those PSU banks whose market valuation has dwindled despite the fact that they hold the bulk of the deposits.

Panagariya noted that it is disingenuous to argue, as many advocates of PSU banks do, that achieving social goals of lending requires two dozen banks in the public sector.

“The fact of the matter is that private sector banks have often performed better than public sector banks in delivering on their priority-sector-lending obligations,” he pointed out.

Asked to comment on recent trade tensions, with US President Donald Trump targeting India, Panagariya said that he would not hesitate to liberalize India’s trade further rather than risk the US closing its markets to Indian goods.

On Nobel laureate Paul Krugman’s recent comment that India story could end with mass unemployment, the former NITI Aayog vice chairman admitted that Krugman is surely right to point to the importance of manufacturing in the economic transformation of a developing country.

“I think manufacturing growth is essential for creating productive and well-paid jobs rather than escape mass unemployment,” he said, adding that the economy is surely creating jobs. “The problem we face is that it is creating very few jobs that fully exploit the potential of our workers,” Panagariya said.

Talking about overall Indian economy, he said that India remains stable in macroeconomic terms. “The GDP growth rate has been on the rising trend during the latest two quarters for which we have data—it rose from 5.7% during the first quarter of 2017-18 to 6.5% in the second quarter and 7.2% in the third quarter. I expect the upward trend to continue,” Panagariya said.

On farmer protests across India, the economist said he always favoured cash transfers to rural BPL (below poverty line) households in times of crop failures via Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. “In the medium run, the government strategy of raising farmer incomes through marketing reforms and increased farm productivity are right on target,” Panagariya said.

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday ordered the attachment of all moveable property disclosed in an affidavit by former Ranbaxy Laboratories promoters, brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh, and others in relation to a Rs3,500 crore arbitration case with Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd.

The court was hearing Daiichi Sankyo’s plea, seeking execution of a 31 January order of the court upholding the enforceability of the arbitral award passed against the Singh brothers and others. Justice Jayant Nath further passed an order for appointment of a chartered accountant (CA) for valuation of assets attached till date. The judge also asked the parties to cooperate with the CA by providing all documents required for valuation.

On 26 February, all assets disclosed by Oscar Investments Ltd and RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd, owned by the Singh brothers, were also attached by an order of the high court.

New Delhi:The telecom industry, which has been witnessing job losses due to consolidation, is expected to create over 10 million employment opportunities in the next five years, as per the skill development body for the sector.

“There are 4 million people employed in the telecom sector and by the end of five years, 14.3 million people will be employed in telecom as well as telecom manufacturing,” Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC) CEO S.P. Kochhar told PTI in an interview.

According to a CIEL HR report, since last year the telecom sector has already lost around 40,000 jobs and the trend is likely to continue for the next six-nine months, with the total figure expected to reach 80,000-90,000.

Kochhar said TSSC, under the National Skill Development Corporation, expects major demand for employment to come from emerging technologies like machine-to-machine communications, followed by telecom manufacturing, infrastructure and services companies.

“We are increasingly seeing manufacturing line coming to India. That gives us a lot of hope in the telecom sector as far as skilling is concerned. There we have huge amount of potential and the projections that are made by telecom manufacturing industry is that 14.2 lakh people will be employed in this sector,” Kochhar said.

He said TSSC is going to build training modules based on national occupational standards which will be prepared in conjunction with the industry and is approved by the government.

Besides, the telecom sector skill body has proposed to the government to change the approach of looking for employment after training to training based on job demand that will come from industry.

Kocchar said players in the telecom sector fear attrition if the workforce is upskilled. “We are trying to allay those fears (upskilling leading to attrition ) and say it will not happen and also telling the industry the benefits of taking skilled manpower,” he said.

Kocchar said TSSC is willing to invest to create a centre of excellence where people can be trained around products in the sector.

“The tower companies are showing interest in this type of a venture. We will invest for creating the training centre and they would give us equipments out of CSR (corporate social responsibility), where we will train all tower technicians and then they are free to employ them. This is the type of ecosystem we are creating in the next one year,” Kocchar added.","Telecom sector to create 10 million jobs in next five years, says skilling council","['jobs', 'create', 'training', 'tssc', 'skilling', 'industry', 'employment', 'kochhar', 'million', 'manufacturing', 'skill', 'council', 'telecom', 'sector']","Kochhar expects major demand for employment to come from emerging technologies like machine-to-machine communications, followed by telecom manufacturing, infrastructure and services companies.

New Delhi: Punjab National Bank (PNB) plans to take part in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond, a group company of jewellery designer Nirav Modi who has been accused of defrauding the state-run bank of nearly Rs13,000 crore.

The bank is exploring all options for the recovery, including participating in the bankruptcy proceeding of Firestar Diamond Inc, officials said.

According to officials, the bank is in the process of hiring legal experts to take the matter forward.

The legal firm would be hired soon. Various pros and cons are being examined in order to make watertight case for the recovery, officials said, adding the bank is part of unsecured creditor category.

When contacted, PNB declined to comment on the matter. Last month, Firestar Diamond, a company owned by Nirav Modi filed for bankruptcy in a New York court. The US Trustee Program oversees administration and litigation for enforcement of the bankruptcy law.

Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi in connivance with certain bank officials allegedly cheated the PNB of Rs12,968 crore through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs). A Mumbai branch of PNB had fraudulently issued LoUs for the group of companies belonging to Nirav Modi since March 2011.

Different investigating agencies, including Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate, are probing the fraud, dubbed as the biggest banking scam in the country.

Scam-hit PNB had issued as many as 1,590 LoUs to Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and their associates. The total number of LoUs issued to the companies of Nirav Modi, his relatives and the Nirav Modi Group are 1,213, and to Mehul Choksi, his relatives and the Gitanjali Group are 377. The amount of repayment made by the companies against each LoU cannot be currently ascertained as the matter is under investigation, finance ministry in a reply to Parliament had said.

PNB has apprised that payment of LoU is a contingent liability and may fall back upon the bank on due date only if the same is not paid on or before due date by the buyer.

New Delhi: The commerce ministry’s investigation arm Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) said it is terminating its anti-dumping probe on imports of solar cells from China, Taiwan and Malaysia. The Indian Solar Manufacturers Association has made a request to terminate the present investigation, it added.

The probe was initiated by the DGAD on 21 July last year following complaints of dumping of the product by the association. “The authority is constrained to terminate the present antidumping investigation concerning imports of ‘solar cells whether or not assembled partially or fully in modules or Panels or on glass or some other suitable substrates’,” from these countries, DGAD said in a notification.

The domestic industry has cited certain reasons for its request to terminate the probe. They have stated that post-initiation, the injury being suffered by the domestic producers on account of dumping has aggravated sharply. Besides, the industry has said that the imports of the cells from these countries have increased substantially in the recent period.

The period of investigation covers April 2016 to June 2017 (15 months). The directorate, however, noted that “the reason cited by the domestic industry for termination of the petition is devoid of any merit”. But it said Rule 14(a) of the anti-dumping rules does not grant any discretion to the DGAD in the matter of termination of investigation, once the domestic industry files a written request for termination of the probe.

Anti-dumping duties are levied to provide a level playing field to local industry by guarding against cheap below-cost imports. Increasing imports and dumping of goods from China have always been an area of concern for Indian companies. India’s exports to China were only $10.2 billion in 2016-17 but imports aggregated to $61.3 billion.

DGAD is also probing dumping of several other products such as certain chemicals and steel products from China and other countries. India is one of the most attractive markets for global producers due to its large middle class population.

Imposition of anti-dumping duty is permissible under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime. Both India and China are members of the Geneva-based body. The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.",Commerce ministry terminates anti-dumping probe on solar cells,"['probe', 'industry', 'imports', 'investigation', 'terminate', 'terminates', 'cells', 'producers', 'domestic', 'china', 'antidumping', 'ministry', 'commerce', 'dumping', 'request', 'solar']","The domestic industry has cited certain reasons for its request to terminate the probe.

Johannesburg/Lima: South Africa escaped a third junk rating as Moody’s Investors Service kept its assessment of the nation’s debt unchanged, citing more transparent and predictable policies under President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The African nation’s outlook was revised to stable from negative. The decision will boost sentiment and probably bolster the rand, which rallied after Ramaphosa took over as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December and became president last month. With the local-currency rating remaining investment grade, the nation avoids being excluded from global benchmark indexes that could have led to outflows of as much as much as 100 billion rand ($8.4 billion).

Moody’s maintained the nation’s local- and foreign-currency assessments at Baa3, the lowest investment-grade level, the ratings company said in a statement on Friday. The affirmation keeps South Africa on the same level as that of Indonesia and Romania.

“The recent change in political leadership appears to have halted the gradual erosion of the strength of South Africa’s institutions,” Moody’s analysts Zuzana Brixiova and Marie Diron wrote in the statement.

Weak growth

While economic growth in Africa’s most-industrialized economy exceeded the government’s forecast last year, it’s been below 2% since 2014. Finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who was reappointed last month, said the National Treasury may raise its projected 1.5% growth forecast for 2018.

“Our economy shouldn’t be performing at this level, we should be performing much higher than 1.5 percent,” Dondo Mogajane, director-general of National Treasury said in an interview. “If you add on the other things that we’ve spoken about, the confidence, telecoms, the barriers to entry issues, transport and focus on agriculture and investment in tourism, clearly all of those combined should give you a decent number that you can add on to the base of 1.5 percent.”

The National Treasury also said it’s working to provide policy certainty on issues such as mining legislation.

The nation’s banking association says stronger fiscal discipline and good governance is required to eliminate wasteful and unauthorized expenditure and to place state-owned enterprises on a sustainable footing, in order to regain its investment rating from all three major credit rating companies.

“This places us in purgatory, so we aren’t going to heaven and we aren’t going to hell either,” Thabi Leoka, an independent economist in Johannesburg, said by phone before the announcement. “We still have very low growth over the next two years and we still have a revenue shortfall, while already surpassing the spending ceiling and we need to fix all of those, quite significantly, before we we can actually be in a comfortable position regarding our rating.”

Fitch Ratings Ltd affirmed the country’s debt scores at its highest non-investment grade in November with a stable outlook while S&P Global Ratings lowered the nation’s rand debt to junk and cut the foreign-currency assessment to two levels below investment grade. S&P is scheduled to make a ratings announcement on 25 May.

The rand led gains among the world’s major peers in the week ended Friday, climbing almost 2% against the US dollar on speculation South Africa would avert a downgrade. The currency has risen more than 5% this year.

Beijing: Apple Inc. chief executive Tim Cook has called for stronger privacy regulations that prevent the misuse of data in the light of the controversial leak of Facebook user information.

Cook called for “well-crafted” regulations that prevent the information of users being put together and applied in new ways without their knowledge during a session on global inequality at the annual China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.

His comments will ramp up pressure on Facebook Inc. and other technology companies that rely on the huge reams of data gathered from billions of people to power their products, services and sales. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg belatedly apologized for failing to better control its customers’ data following reports that it let Cambridge Analytica amass information on 50 million users. The social network’s shares have tumbled 14% following the reports.

“I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,” Cook said after being asked if the use of data should be restricted in light of the Facebook incident. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life -- from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist.”

Cook said his company had long worried that people around the world were giving up information without knowing how it could be used.

“We’ve worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them, that one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it,” he said. “Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once.”

Industry leaders

Top US executives from Google chief Sundar Pichai to IBM’s Ginny Rometty gathered in Beijing this weekend under the shadow of a brewing trade war, as US President Donald Trump prepares to slap tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially affecting more than $50 billion worth of products. Until the US government formalizes the details of the tariffs, the impact on American companies will be difficult to gauge.

Cook said that he held passionate views on the issue and that he’d personally weighed into the debate.

“The countries that embrace openness do exceptional and the countries that don’t, don’t,” he said. “It’s not a matter of carving things up between sides.

Bengaluru: The maker of Bira 91, a popular Indian craft beer with bottles sporting sketches of a quirky monkey with a punk hairdo, is aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) in the next three to five years, its chief executive told Reuters.

B9 Beverages, founded and led by New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations in a country where marketing of alcohol is heavily regulated.

Jain puts it down to the fact that the taste of beer matters to Indian consumers now much more than before. “Younger consumers have a different perception about alcohol,” he said.

Craft beer sales are on the rise in India as younger, affluent consumers in big cities choose brands and pubs that make lighter brews and promise fresher ingredients.

Bira expects its India business to break even in fiscal 2019 and revenue to more than double to about Rs400 crore.

Set up in 2015, B9 Beverages initially manufactured Bira 91—the name references India’s international phone code—in Belgium but supply chain snafus and high costs made it difficult to compete against market leaders Kingfisher, SAB Miller India and Carlsberg.

The supply issues were resolved, Jain said, after he started production in India in late 2016. The company still sources toddy for Bira’s wheat variant, Bira White, from Canada or Europe to ensure quality.

The idea to start the business grew out of Jain’s personal search for good-quality beer after he repatriated to India from the US, where craft beer is hugely popular.

After sputtering efforts to get his fledgling company off the ground, Jain received investments from local venture capitalists and, later, from US-based Sequoia Capital.

Jain, owns 35 percent of the company.

B9 has raised about $30 million in four funding rounds so far. Jain said the company had sufficient funds and was not looking to raise money in the short term.

Still niche

Euromonitor International pegged beer sales in India at 3.1 billion litres last year and expects it to grow to 3.3 billon litres this year.

Jain reckons Bira 91 has a 5% share of the beer market in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Notwithstanding Bira’s success, craft beer is expected to remain a niche market in India in the near future as stronger brews remain a firm favorite, especially in smaller cities, and cost conscious consumers pick cheaper alternatives.

A 330 ml bottle of Kingfisher Strong Premium, which has 8% alcohol content, sells at Rs68 in Bengaluru. In contrast, a bottle of Bira White, with 4.9% alcohol, retails at Rs110.

Bira recently launched a variant with 7% alcohol content.

While the company has a headstart in the domestic craft beer market, it is expected to face competition from global rivals and other Indian brands looking to enter the market.

Bengaluru-based United Breweries Ltd, which dominates the Indian beer market with its Kingfisher Strong beer, has said it plans to launch a craft beer brand by the end of 2018.

But Jain is upbeat about Bira’s prospects.

“We are beginning to see a data point where Bira is not just sort of dominating premium, but actually taking share away from mass market brands. So consumers are actually trading up, paying more for beer that’s more flavourful and resonates with them.” Reuters",Bira beer maker B9 Beverages planning IPO in 3-5 years,"['consumers', 'indian', 'beverages', 'india', 'bira', 'craft', 'b9', 'ipo', '35', 'planning', 'alcohol', 'jain', 'share', 'maker', 'beer', 'market']","Bira 91, founded and led by Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations.

Mumbai: Stock exchanges on Friday accepted the request of Uttam Galva Steels Ltd to reclassify ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV as a public shareholder in the company, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

“Uttam Galva had written to the exchanges on 9 March asking that ArcelorMittal be reclassified as a public shareholder. The exchanges agreed it was a technical issue. While National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) granted reclassification on 22 March, BSE Ltd did it today,” said one of the two people cited above, on condition of anonymity.

While BSE declined to comment, an email sent to NSE was not answered till press time.

The reclassification was important for ArcelorMittal as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) prevents promoters from bidding for assets of an insolvent firm. Uttam Galva is in the second list of NPA (non-performing asset) accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for resolution. Promoter status would have prevented ArcelorMittal from bidding for Uttam Galva as and when it was referred for resolution under IBC.

The reclassification was a technical issue as prior to 7 February 2018, ArcelorMittal held 29.05% of the share capital in Uttam Galva and was named as one of its promoters. On 7 February, ArcelorMittal sold its entire stake to Sainath Trading Co. Pvt. Ltd in an off-market sale.

As per existing norms, exchanges allow reclassification of promoter status on a case-to-case basis.

“In a case where a person does not hold a single share and does not exercise any direct or indirect control over the firm or has any special rights through any formal or informal arrangements, receiving approval of declassification of that person from stock exchanges or market regulator is a matter of procedure. Of course, bourses do examine the bona fides of the applicant so as to not allow misuse,” said Sumit Agrawal, a partner at Suvan Law Advisors. He represents ArcelorMittal.

Meanwhile, Numetal Mauritius Ltd has filed a separate plea challenging the decision of the committee of creditors disqualifying it as a bidder for Essar Steel. Numetal and ArcelorMittal were the two firms that had submitted bids for Essar Steel. Numetal was disqualified under section 29(a) of the IBC as Aurora Enterprises Ltd, owned by a trust controlled by Rewant Ruia, holds a minority stake in the firm.

Although, Numetal had filed a petition on 20 March at the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal seeking clarification on its eligibility in anticipation of its bid being disqualified, the firm filed a separate application challenging the committee of creditors’ decision on 22 March, seeking an earlier hearing date, said a person close to the development. The case will be heard on 27 March. The tentative deadline for fresh bids is 2 April.

123,US shoppers and Chinese suppliers face hit from Trump levy,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/gUr0lNFSVSw4K77nOT1YvJ/US-shoppers-and-Chinese-suppliers-face-hit-from-Trump-levy.html,"Since consumer goods account for a large chunk of exports from China to the US, some Chinese manufacturers are preparing for the worst","Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected as a result of Trump tariff. Photo: Reuters

Shanghai: US President Donald Trump’s move to slap tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports is likely to be bad news for many of China’s exporters—as well as Americans who like wearing Victoria’s Secret bras, Guess jeans or Nike sneakers.

A vast amount of items used by US consumers—from Under Armour leggings to Bath & Body Works shower gel and Samsonite luggage—are sourced from Chinese or Hong Kong based companies and factories, fuelling the $450 billion in Chinese goods imported to America annually. Broad-based tariffs, which the US said would be a 25% duty, may translate into higher sticker prices in stores across the US.

Retailers in the US have pushed back, saying any such levies would amount to a tax on American consumers. In China, meanwhile, small exporters with a heavy reliance on the US worry that their cost advantage could be wiped out in the global supply chain.

“That’s it then, we have no more competitive edge,” said Justin Yu, a sales manager at Zhejiang-based Pinghu Mijia Child Product Co., which makes toy scooters sold at American retailers. “I don’t know what we are going to do.”

The US has yet to announce the list of products the additional duties will be levied on, but has said aerospace, information and communication technology will be targeted. Since consumer goods account for a large chunk of exports from China to the US, some Chinese manufacturers are preparing for the worst.

Yu said exports to the US account for over $10 million of annual revenue for Pinghu Mijia, more than half of its total sales. “Chinese manufacturing has lost its advantage now, so we might as well find some other business to do,” he said.

Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected. If tariffs are raised on its products, Samsonite International SA chief executive officer Ramesh Tainwala sees one logical recourse. “We pass it on to the consumer,” said Tainwala, who spoke to reporters in Hong Kong last week. “We have the pricing power. We are the ones who will move first and the industry will follow.”

Samsonite is in an unusual global position. While the world’s biggest luggage maker is based in Mansfield, Massachusetts, it is listed on the Hong Kong exchange. Samsonite executives say it manufactures two-thirds of its products in China and currently pays a tariff of more than 25% on them to the US.

The impact on other American companies would be widespread, fanning out across the US because of the intricate links with international supply chains. Tariffs hitting one company in China can have a ripple effect across dozens of customers in the US. The connections are particularly strong across the apparel and technology industries.

Apparel and footwear, telecommunications equipment and household appliances are among the Chinese manufacturing sectors with the biggest exposure to the US market, according to a Moody’s research note released on Thursday.

Hong Kong-based Li & Fung Ltd alone collects about two-thirds of its revenue from about 50 consumer-product companies in the US, including retailers Walmart Inc., Kohl’s Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. For Regina Miracle International Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of intimate wear, American demand for lingerie makes up about 60% of revenue. Its customers include lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.

Lenovo Group Ltd, the Beijing-based computer manufacturer, gets almost a third of its $43 billion in annual revenue from North America by selling its products to companies such as HP Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.

Shares of Li & Fung fell 10% in Hong Kong trading on Friday, their biggest drop in five years. Regina Miracle tumbled 2.3%, and Lenovo dropped 2.6%.

Still, large Chinese companies like Li & Fung are likely to get some protection because of the diversity of their businesses and their international chain of suppliers. “With a global network of over 15,000 suppliers in over 40 markets, we are well-positioned to absorb in any shock from trade uncertainty,” Li & Fung said in a statement. “We are unique in the industry, in that if there is any change in trade policy, we have the ability to channel production to any market quickly.”

Other factors may also help insulate Chinese corporations. Many are still reliant on domestic consumers for revenue, reducing their exposure in the event of a trade war. The proportion of Chinese corporate revenue that comes from overseas is an average of only 8.8%, up from 6.6% in 2012, according to research from brokerage Natixis.

Chinese tariffs

China retaliated on Friday morning with reciprocal tariffs worth $3 billion on imports of US pork, recycled aluminium, steel pipes, fruit and wine. Hong Kong-listed pork producer WH Group Ltd—which bought US-based pork giant Smithfield Foods in 2013—gets about 57% of its revenue from the US. It slid as much as 10% on Friday morning.

WH is assessing how to amend its strategy in response to the tariff, spokesman Luis Chein said. Its Smithfield operations in the US currently export to 40 other countries in addition to China. “We do not think it will have a huge impact on our US exporting business,” he said.

Closer to home in the US, smaller companies may feel the brunt of restrictive trade actions, according to Gary Huang, the Shanghai-based founder of consultancy 80/20 Sourcing. Multinationals with mature supply chains like Walmart could shift to Vietnam or India to avoid the tariffs, he said. On Amazon, more than half of product listings come from smaller businesses that source from China, which Huang said would be hit hard.

“These guys are going to be left holding the new tariff bill and those prices will go straight up,” Huang said. “This year’s Christmas could be a lot more expensive.” Bloomberg",US shoppers and Chinese suppliers face hit from Trump levy,"['hong', 'tariffs', 'suppliers', 'products', 'tariff', 'hit', 'revenue', 'trump', 'chinese', 'companies', 'china', 'prices', 'shoppers', 'face', 'trade', 'levy']","Companies are already planning to raise prices if they are affected as a result of Trump tariff.

Kochi: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday expressed fears that artificial intelligence (AI) would take up jobs—both high skilled and unskilled.

With advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics, this was going to change still further, as they take up the jobs,ranging from those in unskilled sweatshops to high-skilled professions like medicine, the former RBI governor said.

“What jobs will humans be able to do in 10-15 years that are immune from threat?Jobs that require high intelligence and creativity; jobs that require human empathy and jobs where human working for us bolster our status in some way,” he said, delivering the keynote address outlining his vision for India at #FUTURE Global Digital Summit, organised by the Kerala government.

He, however, India has to embrace technology and become a leader in the digital transformation taking place around the globe without being bogged down by unfounded fears of job losses, incomes or machines replacing humans.

Among the biggest obstacles to technology adoption were fears of man being replaced by machines — a fear that has existed since the industrial revolution,but never materialised. “Two hundred years since the industrial revolution, jobs are still around. People and society adapt to do the things that machines cannot do,” he said.

“With technology, across every job there is going to be a restructuring, taking away the routine aspects and leaving the creative and customised aspects of that job,” he said. Currently professor, finance at University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Rajan said that in every industrial country, more jobs have disappeared in routine skilled and non routine unskilled jobs, which has partly led to the anxieties.

The former RBI governor said another aspect of the fear was where the incomes would come from; the answer to which was an assured universal basic income. In the Indian context, he said, “we have a huge hunger for capabilities at every level. If we can create incomes at some level, the aspirations of people will ensure their children move up in life and get the opportunities that they did not.”

In terms of business opportunities, the government needs to do far more for start-ups to flourish in India by creating easy paths to incorporation and funding, he said. Rajan said that one of the big lacunae in India was risk financing and so start-ups go elsewhere because they need risk financing, which was not available in the country.

“We have to make sure Indian capital is available because often it is closest to the ground and understands the financing better,” Rajan said. “We have to make sure that the companies of our future are incorporated in India, get Indian financing and expand significantly. We cannot miss out on the AI and robotics revolution,” he said.

Another significant area where India effectively needs a revolution is education and skill building, Rajan said. “We need to remedy weaknesses in education at every stage, build more world-class institutions domestically and bring the talent back from abroad,” Rajan said. “We are not as global as we should be even now. Too many of our people are too poorly educated or skilled to compete in a globalised tech-enabled economy,” Rajan noted.

“If we don’t do that we will end up with a two-tier economy of a few “haves” and a vast population of “have-nots”, which is neither socially stable nor desirable,”he said.",Artificial intelligence will take up even unskilled jobs: Raghuram Rajan,"['jobs', 'machines', 'rajan', 'unskilled', 'artificial', 'india', 'job', 'rbi', 'technology', 'governor', 'financing', 'incomes', 'raghuram', 'intelligence']","Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintKochi: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday expressed fears that artificial intelligence (AI) would take up jobs—both high skilled and unskilled.

Brussels: The European Union is planning to apply tougher consumer laws to social media networks and email providers like Facebook and Google’s Gmail as scrutiny of data protection grows in the wake of an outcry over Facebook’s handling of data.

Under the draft proposal first considered last year, authorities could levy fines of at least 4% of turnover. Currently, EU consumer authorities can only levy small fines and some lack power to sanction companies at all for breaking consumer law.

It is a fresh example of tighter EU rules for technology giants following reports that a political consultancy misused the data of 50 million Facebook users in a bid to influence the 2016 US presidential election.

The proposal would extend the application of EU consumer law to “free” digital services for which consumers provide their personal data instead of paying with money, such as cloud storage services, social media and email accounts.

“Given the increasing economic value of personal data, those services are not simply ‘free’”, said the document seen by Reuters and due to be presented next month.

The proposal would give consumers the right to pre-contractual information and to cancel contracts within 14 days.

It would also require member states to ensure that their national consumer authorities can levy fines of at least 4% of annual turnover, in line with those foreseen under an EU data protection law set to enter into force in May.

The European Commission is also planning a new law regulating the commercial practices of online platforms with smaller businesses, seeking to curtail their huge market power.

EU consumer authorities have been pressing Facebook, Twitter and Google to improve their user terms since last year. While Google’s changes were deemed sufficient, those of Facebook and Twitter only partially addressed the authorities’ concerns. No enforcement action has been taken so far.

The proposal, if agreed by the European Parliament and member states, would also give consumer authorities more teeth to deal with scandals such as Dieselgate, where German carmaker Volkswagen cheated emissions tests.

The Dutch regulator fined Volkswagen €450,000 ($554,085.00) for misleading consumers who bought its diesel cars, the maximum fine possible.

By contrast, VW has pledged billions of dollars to compensate owners of its diesel cars in the United States.

“Totem Infrastructure took a loan from a consortium of eight banks, including Union Bank, wherein the total outstanding dues stand at Rs1,394.43 crore. This account became NPA (non-performing asset) on 30 June 2012,” the person added.

The agency said that Union Bank of India had only recently filed a complaint with the agency against Totem Infrastructure.

It was alleged in the complaint by Union Bank that “the company had diverted funds by opening accounts outside the consortium and through payments of wages by showing excess expenditure and inflated stocks. The entire sale proceeds were not allegedly routed through the dealing branches of consortium banks.”

Union Bank of India declined to comment on the matter.

CBI said that it had tracked the promoters down and “have located the accused at a new place of residence and searches are underway”.

Other persons familiar with the case also confirmed that Totem Infrastructure was engaged in infrastructure projects, wherein “they took subcontracts from Larsen and Toubro Ltd, Ircon International Ltd and similar companies.”

In a statement, CBI added that “the said private company (Totem) based at Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was in the business of EPC (engineering procurement and construction) contractor engaged in road projects, water works, building structures and also undertook works as a sub contractor to various companies.”

Totem Infrastructure did not respond to Mint’s calls or messages.

On Wednesday, CBI registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain for allegedly defrauding State Bank of India (SBI) and 13 other banks to the tune of Rs824.15 crore, while also issuing lookout circulars against the accused.

“The CBI, on Thursday, conducted two fresh searches (locations not disclosed) and questioned Bhoopesh Jain and Neeta Jain in connection with the case and lookout circulars have been issued against those who have been accused,” the person cited above added.

Lookout circulars are issued by the CBI against the accused in a case, so that they cannot flee the country.

Other than Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain, the CBI also booked Tejraj Achha, a partner at Achha Associates; Ajay Kumar Jain, a partner in Ajay and Co.; Sumit Kedia who is a partner at Lunawath and Associates.

While emails and calls to SBI remained unanswered, Kanishk Gold did not respond to calls either.

Both the scams have come in the wake of the Rs12,636 crore PNB fraud case, where the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have filed cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, respectively. However, both Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi have declined to join the investigation.

Kuala Lumpur: India has proposed to build a pipeline from the country’s east coast to deliver oil products, mainly diesel, to Myanmar, a Myanmar government official said on Friday.

“We have already connected (oil and gas) pipelines to China and Thailand, and we considered connecting (oil) pipelines to India as well as Bangladesh.

Southfield/Washington: Just because US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs aren’t directly targeting cars and parts arriving from China doesn’t mean the threat is over. Automakers are continuing to lobby Trump administration officials to minimize the tariffs, lest the Chinese government retaliate against their own efforts to expand in the world’s largest auto market.

“We recognize the issues the President is trying to address but there are better ways to go about this,” said John Bozzella, president and chief executive officer of the Association of Global Automakers, based in Washington. “At the end of the day a trade war will hurt American producers and consumers.”

Trump has ordered sweeping tariffs on at least $50 billion in goods. For now the administration says the levies will focus on three industries—aerospace, information and communication technology, and machinery—areas where the US government perceives the Chinese have been unfair or where there is a large trade deficit.

Automakers still have reason to worry. In his televised address, Trump used cars as an example of China’s unfairness by citing a 25% tariff on US vehicles sold in China compared with only 2.5% on Chinese-made cars coming in. Trump also said he is concerned about protecting US technology. Carmakers build electric vehicles in China and share that technology with Chinese partners.

The US has an $8.9 billion surplus on cars with the Chinese but a $1.5 billion auto trade deficit overall when counting parts, according to data from the US Census bureau. The total trade deficit with China was at least $375 billion last year, with Trump pegging it closer to $500 billion.

“We encourage both governments to work together to resolve issues between these two important economies,” Ford Motor Co. said in a statement.

New York: Crude took a turn lower amid an equity selloff largely pinned to growing apprehension about a potential trade war with China.

Futures edged down 1.3% in New York on Thursday after topping $65 a barrel this week for the first time since early February. US stocks fell and Treasuries jumped as President Donald Trump formally ordered tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, stoking fears of retaliatory measures by the Asian giant.

“It’s simply a risk-off type of day for all global risk assets,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “Considering the scope of yesterday’s rally, a little bit of a pullback shouldn’t come as all that much of a surprise.”

The decline in crude prices is probably a temporary blip. OPEC’s output reductions have lowered inventories, with stockpiles in the US falling below the five-year average for the first time since 2014. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley sees London-traded Brent crude reaching $75 a barrel by the third quarter and also said geopolitical risks tend to be exacerbated when the supply cushion is thin.

West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery dropped 87 cents to settle at $64.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent for May settlement slid 56 cents to end the session at $68.91 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $4.61 premium to WTI.

“If you have more tariffs and restrict trade, there’s just less movement in the economy,” said Mark Watkins, who helps oversee $142 billion in assets at Park City, Utah-based US Bank Wealth Management. Such a slowdown “would potentially lower the overall demand for oil.” Bloomberg",Crude drops as Donald Trump tariffs on China spark trade war concerns,"['tariffs', 'concerns', 'spark', 'york', 'lower', 'took', 'selloff', 'turn', 'drops', 'trump', 'crude', 'donald', 'china', 'barrel', 'trade', 'war']","Crude took a turn lower amid an equity selloff largely pinned to growing apprehension about a potential trade war with China.

New Delhi: The Rajya Sabha on Thursday approved the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2018, enabling the government to raise the limit of tax-free gratuity and to fix the period of maternity leave qualifying as continuous service period through an executive order.

Once the gratuity bill is signed into law by the President, the government will be in a position to raise the tax-free gratuity for public and private sector employees from Rs10 lakh at present to Rs20 lakh, which government employees are eligible for after the implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations.

ALSO READ: How gratuity amount is calculated

An official statement from the ministry of labour and employment said the Payment of Gratuity Bill ensured harmony among employees in the private and public sectors as well as autonomous organizations who are not covered under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules. “These employees will be entitled to receive higher amount of gratuity at par with their counterparts in government sector,” said the statement. The pro-worker move comes at a time of various anti-government protests from farmers, traders and labour unions.

The labour ministry said that the decision to amend the law was taken after considering inflation and wage increase in the private sector. “After enactment of the Act, the power to notify the ceiling of the amount of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 shall stand delegated to the central government so that the limit can be revised from time to time keeping in view the increase in wage, inflation and future pay commissions,” said the statement.

The amendment enables raising the maximum limit of gratuity to such amount as may be notified by the government from time to time, it added.

The law is applicable to employees who have completed at least five years of continuous service in an establishment that has 10 or more persons. Fifteen days’ wage for every completed year of service subject to the ceiling is given as gratuity.

The amended bill also allows the government to raise the maternity period eligible as continuous period of service for gratuity purposes from 12 weeks to such period as may be notified from time to time. The government had earlier amended the Maternity Benefit Act of 1961 to raise maximum paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks by an amendment last year.

Ensuring sufficient retirement savings for workers is important for policymakers as the elderly population has been growing at twice the pace as the general population in the last decade. This trend could necessitate higher public spending on healthcare.

According to a 2016 report by the Central Statistics Office, the elderly population of 60 years and above expanded at the rate of 35.5% during 2001-2011, while the growth rate in the general population was slower by half at 17.7%.

135,How 2 disruptions are reshaping India’s automobile industry,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/gOciF8rbcWgab8685YFytL/How-2-disruptions-are-reshaping-Indias-automobile-industry.html,"For India’s automobile industry, the twin hurdles of electric vehicles and stricter emission norms are closer than they appear. A look at how it is coping with these sector-defining challenges","New Delhi: For India’s top carmakers, it’s the best of times and the worst of times.

2017 has been a blockbuster year for the country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Its models took the top five spots in sales for the first time in a decade. Its market share has risen to 51%, the highest in 10 years. And from all available evidence, 2018 may be even better.

That’s the good news.

The bad news is that things could change quickly, and the recent history of business is littered with examples of how quickly the tide can turn.

This time, India’s top carmakers could be at the short end of the stick, and they know it. What lies ahead is a long and hard struggle as multiple disruptive forces reshape the market.

The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles

Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Maruti Suzuki, under whom the carmaker has stamped its complete dominance over the Indian market, says the company may have to re-invent itself and “start again from zero”.

There are reasons to be wary.

The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles.

That’s not all.

Alongside is a more near-term worry. Carmakers have been asked by the government, keen to reduce pollution, to leap-frog from the current BS-IV emission norms to the much stricter BS-VI by April 2020, skipping an intermediate level.

While success is not guaranteed, Maruti Suzuki is pulling out all stops to make sure that it’s not left behind.

“We are trying to challenge ourselves as time has come to change the game. Hence, we have to review (our strategy) and start again from zero,” Ayukawa says in an interview.

The coming events, automobile analysts say, will allow Maruti Suzuki’s rivals to play catch-up with the market leader.

The dynamics of the Indian automobile market are set to undergo a sea change as global automobile giants such as Renault SA, Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. will use their expertise in electric vehicles (EVs) to undermine current leaders.

“The industry dynamics will change and the players that are leaders today... will not necessarily remain leaders after the electric vehicle dust settles down,” Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, said in an interview.

Mahindra is the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the country and the first auto maker to invest in electric technology in India, giving it an edge over rivals.

“New players who are either non-existent or are small players today could become leaders after the dust settles down,” Goenka said.

Carmakers, at least those that are least prepared for an electric future, have got a breather with the government saying that it won’t announce an Indian EV policy exclusively for electric vehicles, in an U-turn from its earlier position, and instead support all kinds of sustainable mobility solutions.

“There is no need for any policy now,” Nitin Gadkari, minister for road transport, said at a press briefing on 16 February. (read more)

This is a remarkable volte-face, given that as recently as in January, Gadkari had said the policy was awaiting approval from the Union cabinet.

He had earlier outlined the government’s ambitious plan to shift to electric vehicles by 2030.

On 12 March, Mint reported that the government’s think-tank NITI Aayog has tasked at least seven government ministries with framing guidelines to encourage the use of electric vehicles.

Once framed, NITI Aayog will put these guidelines together as an action plan for promoting the use of electric vehicles, four people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.

Notwithstanding the EV policy uncertainty, companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp. are preparing for a time when the now ubiquitous internal combustion engine-run cars become a relic of history.

Suzuki Motor Corp., the parent of Maruti Suzuki, is collaborating with Toyota to make small and affordable electric cars in India.

For Suzuki, protecting its turf in India is linked to its own survival as half of its revenue comes from the Indian unit.

Toyota Motor Corp., on the other hand, has invested heavily in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell-driven vehicles globally instead of electric. It would have had the most to lose if the government encouraged solely electric vehicles.

Still, the company has started to develop electric vehicles in China and has also formed a joint venture with Mazda Technologies Ltd and Denso Corp. Ltd in Japan for developing the requisite technologies for electric vehicles.

The electric vehicles wave will probably hit the Indian shores a few years later than earlier estimated, but another disruption is already keeping Indian automobile makers on their toes.

In 2016, the Union government decided to skip the Bharat Stage-V (BS-V) emission norms and brought forward the date of implementation of the BS-VI emission norms by two years to 1 April 2020, an unprecedented move in the global automotive space.

As a consequence, carmakers had to earmark substantial amounts to upgrade their existing products to meet emission norms at a time when the economy was rattled by policy decisions such as demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST).

Two of the country’s biggest two-wheeler makers—Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd and Royal Enfield—have already announced that they will not launch any new products till 2020. Honda two-wheelers’ (HMSI) plan to establish its fifth manufacturing plant has been frozen despite the company’s factories operating at almost full capacity.

Underscoring the enormity of the task at hand, Minoru Kato, president and chief executive of HMSI, said, “We are considering a fifth manufacturing unit but adhering to BS-VI emission norms by 2020 is the biggest concern. Not only Honda, other manufacturers will also have to comply with the norms. So production cost will increase. Hence, we need to increase price as well. So, the total motorcycle industry sales will decrease in 2020.”

In November 2017, Siddhartha Lal, managing director of Eicher Motor Ltd (which owns Royal Enfield), said the company will not launch any new models in the next two years and the next new offerings will be just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in.

Car launches have also come down by half over the past four years as automobile manufacturers struggle to adapt to rapidly changing regulations, industry executives said.

There were 12 model launches in 2015. That plunged to five each in 2016 and 2017, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

The lacklustre Delhi Auto Expo 2018 in February is a testament of the apprehension among auto makers.

An updated Maruti Suzuki Swift was the only vehicle to be unveiled on the second day of the show, unprecedented in the history of South Asia’s biggest auto show.

Most manufacturers, including Volkswagen group, Ford India Pvt. Ltd, Nissan India Pvt. Ltd and Jaguar and Land Rover India, did not participate in the biennial show.

The ones that participated, such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor, also did not showcase any new models that would be launched over the next year-and-a-half.

For Pratap Bose, head of designing at Tata Motors Ltd, complying with the new emissions norms is never a challenge, but “timelines should not shift and move as the challenge is to plan to a particular date”.

The updated Maruti Suzuki Swift was the only vehicle to be unveiled on the second day of the Delhi Auto Expo 2018.

The automobile industry, contrary to the decision made by the government on electric vehicles, was looking for a direction in which the government wants them to move before investing billions of dollars in electric mobility.

“We need a clear picture from the government, but we cannot wait. Still, we are waiting for a detailed road map to be proposed and developed by the NITI Aayog,” said Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive officer, Hyundai Motor India in an interview.

Ford India Pvt. Ltd’s managing director Anurag Mehrotra concurred with his Hyundai counterpart and said, “Till such time we have a policy framework, it’s a little difficult. It is like shooting in the dark. So you have to be careful that you get your policy and once it is done, we will be able to come back.”

According to Puneet Gupta, associate director at global automotive sales forecasting firm, IHS Markit, China has already announced the electric vehicles policy last year. This has helped all Chinese and global vehicle makers, and they have started working on electric cars in China on a war footing.

Maruti Suzuki, though, did not wait for the government to formulate an India EV policy before taking crucial business decisions pertaining to electric vehicles.

For instance, the company has already announced that it will launch its first electric vehicle in 2020. Besides that, the company will also set up its own charging station for potential customers as the lack of charging stations is one of the biggest impediments facing the industry. It has also started to conduct a survey on customer expectations from electric vehicles.

To be sure, this is not the first time that Maruti Suzuki is faced with a big challenge.

In 2011-12, when diesel car sales started to increase at a brisk pace, the company was found wanting.

Rivals Mahindra and Mahindra and Hyundai Motor chipped away at its market share, until it touched a low of 42% during the year; but the company took a swift decision to buy diesel engines from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and over the next five years, the company steadily regained share with new models.

This time, the company has tied up with Toyota Motor Corp. and will set up its own lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat way ahead of other manufacturers.

Two other embattled passenger vehicle manufacturers—Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors—have also been investing heavily in the development of electric vehicles.

“We think in India also, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have made up their mind to invest in electric car and technology, but more clarity on electric policy can lead to ideas translating into business, which means more jobs and more revenues for the Indian automobile industry,” added Gupta of IHS Markit.

According to a senior industry executive, the automobile industry is extremely resilient, whatever the adversity, and has managed to emerge stronger over the years.

As of now, there are too many impediments on the road to the successful adoption of electric vehicles in India.

The availability of charging stations and sourcing of lithium are probably the two major roadblocks that need to be overcome.

Recently, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL)—a public sector unit under the ministry of power—had to defer the date of taking delivery of electric vehicles from Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra due to the lack of charging infrastructure.

Also, once the BS-VI emission norms come into effect on 6 April 2020, manufacturers and suppliers would need at least five years to get a return on the equity.

The vehicle manufacturers would also need to set up an alternative ecosystem, as mentioned by the Ayukawa, in the next decade or so in order to engineer a smooth transformation to electric vehicles.

“We have to develop the electric vehicle first and compete in the market. As manufacturers, what we can do is to supply good vehicles to the market. That is the only way. Without a product, we cannot do anything,” opined Ayukawa.",How 2 disruptions are reshaping India’s automobile industry,"['indias', 'disruptions', 'industry', 'reshaping', 'india', 'electric', 'suzuki', 'automobile', 'vehicles', 'norms', 'vehicle', 'motor', 'policy', 'maruti']","The automobile industry is at the cusp of a once-in-a-century disruption with the advent of electric vehicles.

Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

In every conference call held in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s quarterly result, the launch of tildrakizumab was a key point discussed. The Halol plant’s non-compliant regulatory status was another. It’s a bit of a surprise then that its shares yawned at the announcement that the firm got a novel drug approval for Ilumya, the brand name for tildrakizumab.

This could be a case of the news already in the price but this was by no means a slam dunk, as seen from the conversations in these calls.

There is the possibility that the company’s continuously flagging US sales growth and inability to clear the Halol hurdle has made investors circumspect, even in the face of positive news. At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

Ilumya is good news in that light, becoming a key contributor to US revenues eventually. This drug was licensed by Sun Pharma from Merck and Co. in 2014, by paying an initial sum of $80 million and while Merck did the work and filings to bring it to market, Sun Pharma has borne all costs.

It has worldwide rights for this product and has out-licensed it for Europe. Sun Pharma will pay Merck milestone-related amounts (the approval itself will trigger a payment) and then royalty on sales that will range from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.

Sun Pharma deserves a pat for getting its licensing candidate right, which targets a large market opportunity. In recent calls, Sun Pharma’s management has said its marketing organization for Ilumya is in place, and some field force recruitments are already done. That means related investments and expenses, to an extent, are already in its expenditure.

Initially, Merck will supply the product and later Sun Pharma will shift production to a third-party facility. Sun Pharma’s management had said that the investment phase for Ilumya—where the company will spend more than it will sell—may last for 1.5-2 years.

In the US, the market for psoriasis drugs is a sizeable one. For instance, Janssen Biotech Inc.’s Stelara earned $4 billion in global revenues in 2017. Janssen also launched a product Tremfya, which is in the same sub-category of IL-23 products, as Sun Pharma’s Ilumya. There are some concerns too, on whether too many products are crowding this market, whether Tremfya will be preferred over llumya, and also positive trial data for a new product risankizumab (being developed by AbbVie Inc.).

In response to a question that asked the revenue potential from speciality products, Sun Pharma’s managing director Dilip Shanghvi said that IL-23 and IL-17 (different sub-categories of immunology products targeting diseases such as psoriasis) are being sold by very large companies with more experience in speciality biologics than Sun Pharma. While the company may not have the same success the large firms may have (in turning it into a blockbuster drug), Shanghvi said it has a good product and sees no reason to not try and match those revenues. He also clarified that the current spend is not geared to handle that kind of volume and upside but Sun Pharma will take that decision closer to market.

After its March quarter results, the management will give a guidance for FY19, which should factor in the impact of Ilumya’s launch. Sun Pharma will probably share some details on its plans for the product and its future. Investors are keeping their hopes low. Whether they are surprised by the management’s guidance remains to be seen. The company has passed a key near-term milestone with the Ilumya approval. Sun Pharma’s investors seem to be fixated more on its ability to get the Halol facility compliant for them to change their cautious view.","Sun Pharma: One down, Halol to go","['products', 'pharmas', 'merck', 'pharma', 'halol', 'management', 'product', 'revenues', 'ilumya', 'market']","At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017.

Of course, it is certain that Mahindra has not given up the battle. In a recent Investor Day presentation at Mahindra Research Valley, the senior management focused on the auto business. The host of launches lined up in the UV segment in the coming months indicates that the company hopes to stage a comeback and regain its lost market share. But this is easier said than done.

Note that when Maruti Suzuki was steadily conquering the UV market by tweaking its range and launching relatively cheaper compact UVs, such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis, Mahindra was caught napping. Lack of products in the compact segment was its biggest failure. And now, the road ahead is arduous and rife with competition. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. is a strong competitor with deep pockets. It has garnered nearly a fifth of the UV market in just two years. There is also Toyota Motor Corp. that is keen on expanding its presence in the Indian market from the present 12%.

Therefore, Mahindra’s struggle would be far greater than what it was seven years ago, when it was the market supremo. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “If Mahindra is targeting a market share of 30% in UVs, it appears achievable.” That said, it is highly unlikely that the company will regain its stronghold with a 50%-plus market share in UVs.

Add to this, the costs of advertising and marketing to keep abreast of competition especially from Maruti Suzuki—whose reach is relatively greater—might dent profitability unless the new launches rake in strong sales volume. As such, the share of its auto division in the overall Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) has declined from two-thirds to one-third, ever since it lost ground in UVs. Profit margins have ebbed too.

Thankfully, Mahindra’s farm equipment division’s stellar growth rate over the last two years on the back of a favourable monsoon and a growing rural economy, has partially offset the pain in the auto division.

From an investor standpoint therefore, FY19 would be the make or break year for the auto segment. With Maruti Suzuki being a strong force to contend with and in the lead position, it is a tough road ahead for Mahindra.

This explains why Mahindra’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has been sticky at around 17, in spite of two strong growth years for the farm equipment division.",Mahindra on rough terrain as Maruti Suzuki grabs No. 1 slot in utility vehicles,"['market', 'auto', 'terrain', 'utility', 'suzuki', 'vehicles', 'grabs', 'strong', 'slot', 'share', 'mahindra', 'uv', 'rough', 'segment', 'uvs', 'maruti']","Maruti Suzuki has steadily captured the utility vehicle market from Mahindra by tweaking its range and launching compact UVs such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis.

138,"Thanks to Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are squeezed from both ends",https://www.livemint.com/Money/6tHBK70v3xpybP7azhBw9I/Thanks-to-Reliance-Jio-Airtel-Vodafone-and-Idea-are-squeez.html,"That Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst just rubs salt into their wounds","Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well.

Reliance Jio’s relentless aggression isn’t limited to its pricing strategy; there is no end in sight to its capacity for investments in the telecom sector.

Based on recent data presented in the Lower House of Parliament, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate that Reliance Jio has a 62% share of the combined data capacity of the country’s big four mobile companies. In other words, its capacity is about 1.6 times the capacity of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd combined.

But according to an analyst at another institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio also carries about two times the data traffic these three companies manage between themselves.

As such, Reliance Jio too needs to augment capacity to support growth, which it indeed is busy doing. The company has told analysts it will increase the number of base stations to around 200,000 in the next few quarters, or by about 25% from current levels. The above-mentioned analyst says that channel checks with suppliers suggest the count will go up to as high as 250,000 eventually.

What all of this means is that incumbents need to step up investments to keep up pace.

“Even as we do not think incumbents need to match Jio on data capacity anytime soon, we do believe they need to accelerate their efforts in closing the gap. This may mean elevated levels of capex for the next two-three years, in our view, posing upside risks to capex forecasts,” Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients.

This comes at a time when cash flows are drying up. Idea generated next to nothing in terms of cash last quarter, and that was before a series of tariff cuts by Reliance Jio in January. Needless to say, the increasing gap between cash flow and capital expenditure needs to be funded through other means.

So it isn’t surprising that all operators are busy with asset sales, equity/bond issuances or a combination of both. Airtel has periodically sold stakes in its tower infrastructure company and is even considering listing its Africa business to generate funds. Idea has diluted equity, while Reliance Jio is raising over $2 billion (Rs13,000 crore) in debt to fund capital expenditure.

From the looks of it, the need for funds will remain high, given where analysts’ estimates are with respect to capex needs. The fact that some telecom firms are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst and their stocks are beaten down just rubs salt into their wounds.","Thanks to Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are squeezed from both ends","['vodafone', 'airtel', 'data', 'pricing', 'need', 'telecom', 'needs', 'reliance', 'jio', 'squeezed', 'idea', 'companies', 'analysts', 'capacity', 'thanks', 'ends']","Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/MintThe general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing.

139,‘Insolvency code biggest reform in banking’,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/MYZBFK8DlJ8Lw9lIHrr9HK/Insolvency-code-biggest-reform-in-banking.html,"Panellists at MintAsia’s third global banking conference in Singapore say the insolvency code, PSU bank recapitalisation and GST are indicators the nation is taking the right policy steps","This is not the right time for privatizing India’s public sector banks—both from the government’s perspective, and also from a valuation and market standpoint, but the time has come for the consolidation of non-performing, government-owned banks, and the country needs to take the debate forward on forming a bank holding company. This seemed to be the consensus among panellists at MintAsia’s third global banking conference in Singapore recently.

“The point is not about ownership. It is about the separation between ownership and management. It is about the professionalism of management. We have had a good debate in India for a while on having a bank holding company—that would be more meaningful, and even if I talk from the market perspective, an owner does not sell any asset when the going is not good, and also does not sell when there is a possibility that you can get the going good in the future—it makes sense to increase valuation and exit at a later stage, rather than making these distress sales. So, even from the market’s perspective, it might not be a good idea,” S.S. Mundra, former deputy governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said at the event held in a packed Skysuite at Swissotel, The Stamford, on 9 March.

Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India, said the first step towards reviving public sector banks was to improve the quality of governance at the board level and also at the top management. “This is entirely in government hands. I don’t appoint my board, I don’t appoint my managing director. To that extent, the onus is on government to find the right people, to man the boards and for management of PSU banks. We don’t need 20 something public sector banks. But you don’t consolidate when everyone is weak—if you do that, you are selling them very cheap. It does not make economic sense to divest at today’s price,” he added.

Indeed, while India’s banks may not be in the best of shape, the future remains bright as some of the big-ticket reforms that have been implemented come to play. The insolvency code, the biggest banking reform in recent times, the government’s recent move to recapitalize PSU lenders, and the goods and services tax (GST)—the biggest tax reform the country has ever seen, are indicators that the nation is taking the right policy steps. This seemed to be the consensus among the panellists.

The event took place amid a debate in India on loan defaults, bank frauds, tax evasion and corruption, in the wake of the $2-billion fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB), the country’s second biggest state-run lender. This is also seen as the biggest bank fraud in India’s history, allegedly perpetrated by jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who colluded with rogue executives at one of PNB’s Mumbai branches, to secure credit from overseas lenders using fraudulent guarantees.

The discussion was moderated by Tamal Bandyopadhyay, consulting editor of Mint. Edited excerpts:

Tamal: Everything appeared to be working fine in the Indian banking scene. RBI had been aggressive in getting banks to clean up books. State bank of India (SBI) itself has been ruthless in cleaning up its books. You even announced a loss in the December quarter. One fine morning, PNB sends a note to NSE (National Stock Exchange of India Ltd) in a fraud case of Rs280 crore—that is fine—and 2-3 days later, the fraud amount becomes Rs11,700 crore. Then it becomes $2 billion-plus. Then we have other names like Mehul Choksi, Rotomac Pen’s Vikram Kothari. We want some clarity. Is this some sort of contagion, or is there a witch hunt on? Are we being unfair to the banking community? There is a lot of talk the nexus between bankers and corporates and promoters. Give us your sense.

Rajnish Kumar: The PNB fraud was as much a shock to the general public in India as much to bankers. We all thought that it was a challenge on the asset quality of the firm. We have taken up the challenge. We will clean it up. In the December quarter, SBI did a very aggressive clean-up, and we are ready for another round in March. The climate has become positive as a result of the capitalization programme of the government. We saw our share price and market capital go up by 30% in three days, and there is a lot of discussion happening that if government capital is coming, what are the obligations on the recipient banks, and what will they do in return? Incidentally, one fine morning, the PNB fraud comes in, and the narrative changes. So, definitely, it exposed the weakness in PNB at a particular branch. We don’t yet know what PNB has found in its investigations. I am sure that after the investigations, it will be shared with all other banks, but apparently all systems and controls failed. That is the obvious conclusion. Is that the situation among all the banks and all the branches? I think it will be a very wrong conclusion to draw. In my view, it is a one-off incident limited to a particular branch, limited to and caused by some particular employees.

Frauds in the banking and financial systems do happen everywhere. But a fraud of this magnitude, this size and that it went undetected for so long—that has rattled everyone. There have been instances of fraud being detected in 3-5 months… There have been small frauds being committed by some insiders going on for years and being detected in 4-5 years. The problem with the banking system or the financial system is that frauds happen regularly. In 1992, we had the Harshad Mehta scam; in 1997, we had issues in South-East Asian countries; in 2008, we had the global financial crisis. So, I don’t see any contagion in India.

It is an unfair comment in my view to say there is a nexus between bankers and corporates and promoters, or to say PNB was receiving a high fee-based income from these transactions. We don’t know how much PNB was making out of these transactions. But there is no nexus. One thing is a fact: corporates definitely receive more attention than common man does from the top management of banks. I haven’t seen any farmer walking into my office—but when large corporates come to the office to discuss things, sometimes this creates a situation where people feel that if you are an important person, you have access to the chairman of the bank. So that is definitely the ground reality. But let me tell you that in India, there are at least one million people in banking. Out of one million, there may be a few black sheep here and there, which is possible in any organization and in any profession. But if a large mass of bankers was not honest, the system would collapse not in years, but in months.

Tamal: Mundra, you were deputy governor in charge of supervision and regulations. You were also a commercial banker heading a large public sector bank. You were probably the first person in 2016 who in one of your speeches flagged the lacunae in the system that core banking solutions (CBS) of the banks were not integrated with SWIFT. Wearing the regulator’s hat, could you tell us what went wrong and who is to be blamed?

Mundra: Frauds in the banking system have been happening, and they will continue to happen. About 2,500 years ago, Kautilya (Chanakya) had written about 40 ways in which funds could be embezzled by those handling them—these are eternal truths—and the PNB fraud shows they’ve found the 41st way.

We also know that internationally, there have been several instances of frauds with bigger dimensions, but I fully agree with Rajnish—frauds happen when someone is using some intelligent method, using technology in a way which is unimaginable, but with PNB, this was something, which is really very rudimentary. A fraud of this kind to run for a long period is a complete failure of the controls we have in place. What are those controls? There are several questions. What was the management doing? What about the auditors? what were the regulators doing? People are even asking what were the finance minister and the Prime Minister doing? We need to put this in perspective—there are some basic fundamentals that are there. Someone created the transaction and someone verified it. If two eyes can be compromised, then four eyes can also be compromised. But, at the end of the day, transaction logs are created, the branches are put under concurrent audits. The auditors are required to look at all transactions, there is also a requirement that people in sensitive posts, they should be sent on surprise leave, there is also a requirement of job rotation—if all these preliminary checks, if they have not been observed, most of this will be under the level of local management. You can’t expect the apex management to be looking at each of these issues.

What was the regulator doing? When we see the debate that is happening in India currently, it implies RBI is expected to repeat the audit of every branch of every single bank. And do that for a branch that is audited by internal auditor, external auditor, the concurrent auditor, statutory auditor—and on top of that, the public is now expecting the regulator to check every transaction that is happening in the country. I think we are seeing a lot of uninformed and unrealistic kinds of discussions. Regulators globally show the direction, they come up with a fraud detection framework. In 2016, I had indicated that CBS of banks was not integrated with SWIFT. At that time, there were some isolated incidents that were happening. People ask why did we (RBI) not roll out regulations on this. Let us be objective. Each bank is at a different place in its technological journey. There are different levels of systems and capabilities. In the normal course, no regulator would like to give a broad dictation, but only show the direction of risk, and it is expected that each institution would take a business call. If we were dictating on every weakness, then RBI will be accused of micromanagement. Particularly in public sector, we have to understand one thing—they were late entrants into technology, and their adoption of tech has not been happening in a very consistent manner, and the other important thing that we must understand, particularly in public sector banks, we have a situation where the supervisor must have much better technological skills. It means you have to have a very centralized surveillance system. Today, with technology, artificial intelligence, this is possible.

I think PNB was a localized phenomenon. When I say local, I don’t strictly mean a branch—we are a federal structure. It could be a bank, it could be one region, it could be a state. In this case, that PNB branch has a line of command to the head of a particular region—it could be at that level.

Tamal: The fallout of all this is that banks have stopped lending again. We are also seeing PNB’s refusal to admit its obligations, and rather than trying to say it is a fraud where multiple banks are involved, is creating problems with trade finance segment. It is very difficult to get letters of credit and other instruments now. You need a co-guarantee. The discount rate has gone up. For importers, the cost of money is going up.

Rajnish: When an incident or accident of this magnitude happens, it is natural that there will be a reaction in the market. As far as PNB is concerned, there have been very categorical statements from its management that they will honour all bona fide transactions. In SBI, we have examined each and every letter of undertaking, and I believe these are bona fide transactions, and we have submitted our documentary evidence. When something like this is happening, my fear is that the entire management is busy. One day with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the next day with the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), then Enforcement Directorate (ED)—it is a trying moment. In this situation, probably for even banks like us, we are very anxious that our money is paid as quickly as possible, but we need to have some patience. We need to give some time to the PNB management. Let them examine every transaction, and wherever they find these are bona fide transactions, I am confident that they will pay. PNB is the largest bank in the country after SBI, and I fully believe its responsible management won’t do anything that damages their reputation permanently, or that of the Indian banking system.

So, everybody will need to have some patience and not rush to conclusions. That said, this is a fact that the global banking community and investors have a certain amount of nervousness dealing with Indian banks. For all banks, risk management departments would have started asking questions to their relationship managers—this is natural. When you say banks are not lending, it is not an outcome of what has happened in PNB. PNB is purely an operational issue. But the past three years, banks in India have been struggling with non-performing assets (NPAs). With NPAs, the learnings have come at a huge cost for banks. So, it is not business as usual for me—should I not look at my underwriting standards, and wherever there were gaps and weaknesses? I need to necessarily plug them. And if that gets equated with risk aversion, then let it be. But at the same time, all of us realize that banking is still about taking deposits in and lending money. So that activity cannot undergo a change—for SBI, I can tell you that if you bring a quality proposal, which meets my underwriting and price expectations, I will not say no. The willingness to do business is still there. Because of PNB, attention has been diverted, and that is natural. Nobody today would be looking at expanding the top line at any cost. That consciousness is pretty much there. It is as much a demand issue on corporate credit side and not just supply side issues.

Tamal: So you are saying that SBI is not risk-averse, but that you have become more meticulous, because of NPAs. What is happening with NPAs? RBI has asked all banks to come clean in the next 15 months, or five quarters. What kind of pressure will the banks undergo? Will we see banks continuously declaring losses? Will SBI see another loss in the March quarter?

Rajnish: I can’t predict whether we will have a loss in the March quarter. On losses, I can speak only for SBI—mark to market is something on which we have less control. We have requested RBI for some relief or some alignment in line with the international financial reporting system. So we are not asking something that is not doable. This is a discussion that is going on, and we have to wait on what RBI has to say. According to RBI’s 12 February circular, as soon as there is a default, you have to start thinking about a resolution plan, and resolution plan must be implemented in 180 days. If it is a temporary problem that gets resolved, then it’s fine. And if it’s not, then you have to think of a resolution plan, and that must be implemented within 180 days. If not, there are regulatory guidelines to take it to National Company Law tribunal (NCLT).

Let me talk about the positive outcomes—in the past three weeks, I have seen that the borrowers have responded very well. Now there’s a situation where you don’t pay for a single day, and you come under the radar, there is a real threat that you will lose your business under insolvency code. So, that is definitely bringing in enhanced activity from corporates. To that extent, the banking system and the overall financial system will benefit because of the discipline brought in by the 12th February circular and the insolvency code. Why did we not see this three years ago? Because there was no insolvency code then. I consider the insolvency code to be the biggest reform in the Indian banking sector. 2017 has been the year of big bank reforms.

Nothing changes for banks because we were working on a resolution plan earlier and we will also work on the resolution plan now. Depending on each bank’s situation, there will be an impact of this recognition of this category—where a 90-day default will now have to be provisioned under NPAs. On the provisioning side, of course, on the date it becomes sub-standard, then you provide 15%, and for those above Rs2,000 crore, it is a 12-15-month process. So, on the actual incurred losses, banks will be providing in the next 12-15 months.

But there are many impractical suggestions in that circular. For example, 20%, unless it’s paid, you cannot upgrade the account. It is impractical. In that specified period, even if there is a single day’s delay, then within 15 days, you need to refer it to NCLT.

In a business, say if I can’t upgrade an account for four years, and then in four years, I am expecting there will never be a situation for that business, where they can’t afford even a single-day default, and we take them to NCLT, it is highly impractical.

We have made a representation to RBI. But again, I am saying that the spirit of the guidelines and the discipline it brings in will be good for the banking system, good for corporate lending. If there is enhanced pain, the pain was already there, it is fine. Fiscal 2018 is the worst year. You can call it a washout year. After this quarter, things will start improving—this is my assessment. This is based on deep analysis of each and every account which we are handling. Even after the 12 February circular, I will stick to what I had said after our third quarter results.

Tamal: As a regulator, you had a ringside view of how the NPAs panned out. Why did it happen?

Mundra: Let me add a couple of points. The good news is that, and a large part of this audience understands, what we have seen in past 1.5 years is more of a recognition of the problem that was already sitting in the system rather than a new problem. In the banking system, as you start a continuous process recognition, as you come down on the ticket size—when I put all of that into perspective—I won’t be surprised that we still have a struggle for the next 4-6 quarters for a large part of the system. Sir Winston Churchill famously said a good crisis should never be allowed to go waste. This is that kind of crisis. There is no point halting it midway. So the discussions should continue. From a policy perspective, whatever is happening is right. But I have a grievance about the implementation. India’s policies are always world-class. The problem is our execution. That is where we get into the mess that we’ve been seeing. In a lighter vein, just like you have ethical hackers to test IT systems, whenever we have a new policy, we can have a group of ethical policy hackers, who can see how the policy can be abused.

Directions are right, but I think some of the reactions and the way we are implementing, we are going overboard. Like for RBI to say that banks recognize on the very first day of default and initiate recovery, and do weekly reporting of every account—how can an account not ever become overdue for even a day—for any medium-, large-size account, there are 25 to 30 creditors. It means from the first day onward, everyone from the chairman and general manager will be busy getting in touch with each other because the regulator has said that start discussion on recovery. Even as they start talks, news will come in that borrower has repaid on the third day, as he has sorted out his temporary cash flow issues. These are two extreme measures. Now the government has announced that for all accounts of more than Rs50 crore, check for frauds—the problem with the banking system is that the one who is assigned is obliged to find the fraud—this is the reality. Now, who defines fraud? Let’s say, for example, an SME is facing a genuine problem in getting a loan diverted for his working capital because he cannot hold his demand/order—now, this can be looked at as a fraud. When you leave the interpretations so wide, it becomes a problem. Over the past 10 days, every investigating agency has been calling top executives of banks—from chairman to CEOs, and I see a competition here—if one agency interrogates a chairman for 2 hours, another does for 4 hours, and the third for 6 hours. Now, if the entire senior management of India’s banking system is spending their time answering queries of agencies—yes, agencies are trying to find the root of the problem—but, why can’t you create an empowered group with representatives from all investigating agencies who can work together? Let them collectively meet the top management. Now we are seeing some showmanship between the different agencies. The direction is well-meaning but look at the implementation.

Now, what has caused NPAs? It is easy to assign blame and say bankers were corrupt, regulators were careless. There are four contributing reasons and each is equally responsible—the chemical compound or proportions may be different for each case.

First, there were promoters who were rogue. Second, there are promoters who are over ambitious because the economy was growing in double-digits, and their projections were very ambitious. Third, there were bankers who bought such theories presented by the promoters and believed that these companies would be able to repay in a growing economy. Fourth, and we are not talking about it, the policy direction that’s been happening for the past 5-to6 years at all levels—government, executive, judiciary—they have contributed equally. Until we look at all these areas and learn the right lessons, I am sure we will see a repetition of what has happened.

Obviously, I would refrain from mentioning names or departments. As far as the judiciary pronouncements, be it gas supply, iron ore mining, coal mining or spectrum—there have been a series of judgements. We have instances where power plants have been put up and the new chief minister scraps all earlier agreements. From cancellation of coal mines, now chief ministers are cancelling projects or revising earlier agreements. Look at the collateral damage. This brings suspicion on our policies and our system. Entrepreneurs will become sceptical. One more specific example without giving names—there was a mega steel plant, which was put in the western side of the country. To bring this energy and production on the eastern side of the country, they put up another plant, which was supposed to transport the slurry through a pipeline. I’m not defending the promoters. They might’ve taken their pound of flesh and they are not known to be generous to investors or lenders. I’m leaving that aside. Now, let’s say the pipeline is about 250km. To my mind, it was completed for 236km—for 14km in between is passing through a forest, so the environment issue is there, and it was not getting clearance. There was even an offer from the promoters that the 14km they could lay the pipeline underground, but that was also not considered appropriate. This remained in limbo for 2-3 years. Now, if you put a capital cost and for three years it’s in limbo, it will hurt the project. There are numerous such examples.

(From audience) Does all of this mean that for SBI, as you are hit from all directions, what is the strategy for PSU banks? Has RBI been too harsh ? Is that a result of a breakdown in communication between all the stakeholders?

Rajnish: For SBI, as far as the balance between credit and investment goes, lending continues to be the dominant activity. Investment is a small portion and not the dominant one. It is only by compulsion, due to demonetisation, because of the extra money that came in, we had no choice but to invest in government securities. Otherwise, by choice, we would never buy government securities, particularly more than what it is required by regulation. Our primary activity is still the depositing and lending, and we will not have shied away from that—there may be a transition period of 3-to6 months and some disruptions but, ultimately, if the banks don’t lend, then they cannot survive.

Mundra: Just one point here. Yes, there are big-bang reforms and all, including RBI should be supportive of that. My only point is that if there is a diagnosis that requires chemotherapy, it has to be given at a measured pace. You can’t administer six chemotherapies in five days and expect the patient would become better faster. You are only killing the patient. For RBI, I would only say that you don’t speak when it is needed—that is a problem. You speak when it is not needed, then that is also a problem.

(From audience) What about privatization? That can be a solution for PSU banks.

Mundra: I have always believed that performance can be ownership neutral, and privatizing the banks is not going to be the solution. As a public sector banker, I’ve said that in India, at least, we have made public sector banks by choice. During the 2008 crisis, in all the advanced economies, the public ownership of banks was due to default and by compulsion—not by choice. The point is not about ownership. It is about the separation between ownership and management. It is about the professionalism of management. We’ve been having a good debate in India for a while on having a bank holding company—that would be more meaningful, and even if I talk from the market perspective, an owner does not sell any asset when the going is not good, and also does not sell when there is a possibility that you can get the going good in the future—it makes sense to increase valuation and exit at a later stage, rather than making these distress sales. So, even from a markets’ perspective, it might not be a good idea.

Rajnish: The track record of private ownership of banks in India has not been good, except for 2-3 private banks. You look at history. How many private sector banks have had to be bailed out? The only solution RBI has been able to find has been to find another bank and force it to take over the troubled bank. That is the history of private sector banking in India. If you look at the period between 1961 and 1969, the track record of private sector banks was really poor, which led to nationalization. So, when you talk about governance deficit at public sector banks, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. But by changing the ownership, will we achieve the desired result? That is debatable. Like in a PNB-like situation, if it was not government ownership, you would have had a run—not only on PNB, but the entire banking system in the country would have been on the verge of collapse. And apart from that, whenever you travel to India—when you step into Bombay (now Mumbai) airport, or Delhi airport, or any other airport, you should always think that it is the contribution of public sector banks that have created these projects. When you travel on highways, anywhere in India, they may be limited, but you should thank public sector banks for their contribution. Because they lend to these infrastructure projects, you are travelling on these roads. Today, India has a power surplus situation—while I personally think that there is no surplus—remember that we’ve added 75,000 MW of capacity—it was PSU banks that bankrolled these projects in the past 5-6 years.

So, criticize where it is due—definitely, we have issues around governance, but there are many things public sector banks have done and, unfortunately, in the current debate, this is being lost

(From audience) What is your take on fintech?

Rajnish: Fintech is being celebrated as a competitor to us. But, for fintech firms in India, it is very difficult to scale up. The opportunity for collaboration is coming as the technologies they are bringing are of immense use to incumbent players like us. At the same time, the kind of platform we can provide, our customer base—it will take the fintech start-ups 100 years to get that kind of reach. There is a great need for collaboration between fintech firms and India’s leading banks—if fintech start-ups have taken the initiative for innovative solutions, it does not make sense for me to spend my time, effort, and money, when the start-up can provide a solution to the problem. At SBI, we are very active with fintech start-ups, we get procurement from them, we invest in them and we use their collaborative methods. That is a good story, and this is what we’ve been doing so far to ensure that we are there as far as innovation in financial services space is concerned.

Tamal: We’ve discussed as to how privatization may not be the solution to save PSU banks. But if you look at India’s public sector banks, you see the factory is not working in full capacity—50% of them are non-functional. So what can be done? We live in this age of romance and nostalgia, and say it is PSU banks that are helping build bridges and infrastructure. Yet, most PSU banks are sick.

Rajnish: There is nothing wrong with taking pride in what you are doing and what you’ve done—so, we will continue to take pride in what we are doing. But the problem is really complex. I must give due credit, of course, and I always do that—the new-generation private banks have contributed a lot to the development of India’s banking sector. In fact, it was the wake-up call given by them that changed the banking landscape—before that, we (SBI) were the largest in the universe, there was no competition; we could keep the client waiting for six hours and then say, “sorry I can’t meet you”. That was the situation once; but it all changed. Be it a home loan, car loan, other loans, personal loans, private banks brought the changes, and public sector banks then responded well to these changes, and they, too, began to do technology innovations, expanded their offerings to customers. But if you ask me what to do, today is not the right time to privatize PSU banks—and on that, I am certain. The first thing you would have to do in that stage is a single-minded effort towards improving the governance—governance can improve only when the quality of the board level and the executive level is good. This is entirely in government hands. I don’t appoint my board, I don’t appoint my managing director. Who does those appointments? It is the government. To that extent, it is the onus on the government to find the right people, to man the boards and for the management of PSU banks. This is the first step that has to be done. It may take two years to put the house in order for all these 21 PSU banks, and we need to consolidate some of the PSU banks. We don’t need 20 something public sector banks. But you don’t consolidate when everyone is weak—if you do that, you are selling them very cheap. It does not make economic sense to divest at today’s price. The government is also not in some distress position that they have to sell banks and recover their monies—if I were a private owner, I would never sell my venture in this situation. So, once we are able to put the right people at the top and board level, maybe there is some hope, because, ultimately, you need the leaders to guide you from the current crisis situation, make them stronger over a two-year period, and I think the environment is changing towards where I believe things will be better, going forward—once PSU banks have regained a certain amount of confidence, and once again as performance improves, that would be the right time for some level of consolidation.

In my view, India’s current socioeconomic conditions are not conducive to privatization. Maybe after 20 years you will have that situation where you can privatize. With due respect to private sector banks, you send a farmer or a person with Rs200 or Rs500 in his pocket and get his account opened in a private sector bank, then I agree that everybody should be privatized.

Mundra: I can count seven or eight banks in the public sector, which I can’t name, which have no reason to exist. These banks have been stagnant for some time, they have been shrinking and they have lost their identity—they can get their identities by merging with other banks. I think the time is now ripe for a serious discussion on a bank holding company—whatever be the name of this entity, let the bank company start with a government majority, and this holding company should hold a majority in the banks. Next step, the bank holding companies should do away with the majority in the individual banks, and step two, the government should do away with a majority in the bank holding company. That should be the road map. It might take 10-to-15-to-20 years but as long as there’s a clear road map, there is a clear will, I think this should be the real possibility.

Tamal: The government announced bank capitalization last October. PSU banks got a new lease of life in terms of the stock market reaction to this. Now with all the new developments afte",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 that, is this capital enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rajnish: The number of banks that went into PCA (prompt corrective action), they got capital, too. But to bring them out of PCA,, or how much is needed. As for SBI, I can say we are not dependent on government capital as of now to meet our requirements. For the industry, they are definitely dependent on the government, and whatever capital is allotted will have to go to these banks. Yes, the situation on the capital front for PSU banks has become weaker as a result of all that has happened so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mundra: I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations. All I can say is that the capital that is given or seems to be coming would at best be survival capital, not growth capital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His Excellency, Jawed Ashraf, High Commissioner of India to Singapore: I would like to join this debate and just add one point. Sometimes,, you’re actually doing a bit of disservice to the whole debate of how we do the restructuring and improve the situation. I agree with Mundra, and I want to re-emphasize the point that this really is ownership neutral when we are talking about governance. Being in the government, let me give you two examples. Isro (Indian Space Research Organization) and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in India. Both departments are run entirely within the government. Isro’s success in space programme is undeniable, and so is DAE’s success in developing the full nuclear cycles—we are one of the few companies in the world that have done it. By the way, since I handled both ministries for four years, I can say that it was purely because of a different governance structure that these organizations succeeded. Everything is owned by the government, but because there was autonomy and respect for professionalism, there was an absolute hands-off approach to what we did, or what they did, and because there was respect for scientific knowledge, we achieved success. Our IITs and IIMs are government-owned. They have a governance structure that works. The debate is going in the right direction, but we must get out of this short-term, straight, big decisions of whether it is private sector or public sector that works. Both have a role. But with the current economic situation, I think we have to look through, especially those who work in consulting firms. Remember, banks here in Singapore are also owned by the government. What I am saying is that it is also a question of how do we govern our banks. It is not just about the equity. I think part of the change that is desired is not about whether we sell off the shares. And, again, you need to think about who are going to be the buyers, where will you get that kind of equity infusion to buy the kind of stakes we are talking about in all of these banks. I think one point I wanted to re-enforce is that ownership is not a function of performance, and performance is not a function of ownership. Second, the debate must go beyond that in order to make the banks a success.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tamal: This is a complex debate and this must go on. Both the panellists agree that privatization at this time is not the right step, and at the same time, both of them agree that governance is an issue and there are ways of tackling it. Finally,, we’re not denying, we know what are the issues. I’m sure between RBI, the government and the owner of PSU banks, they are gearing up to do more things. Maybe if the current government comes back with this sort of majority, maybe even bigger reforms will be undertaken. As we’ve discussed, the insolvency code is the biggest banking reform—and if you read through it," our policy is more aggressive than most developed countries. We have GST—that is the biggest tax reform India has ever seen. We can do more and are willing to do more.""",‘Insolvency code biggest reform in banking’,"['banking', 'bank', 'india', 'reform', 'banks', 'biggest', 'system', 'say', 'insolvency', 'code', 'management', 'pnb', 'public', 'sector']","The problem with the banking system or the financial system is that frauds happen regularly.

To that extent, the banking system and the overall financial system will benefit because of the discipline brought in by the 12th February circular and the insolvency code.
I consider the insolvency code to be the biggest reform in the Indian banking sector.

140,Indian IT’s dilemma: To buy or not to buy,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/S92Vu1knO0HduDa7muhF7J/Indian-ITs-dilemma-To-buy-or-not-to-buy.html,Mint Asia takes a look at whether Indian IT companies can build new businesses without an aggressive acquisition strategy,"By spending $3.4 billion across 70 acquisitions in the past three years, Accenture has outspent India’s two most acquisitive outsourcing firms, Wipro and Infosys.

Three years. Seventy acquisitions. $3.4 billion.

That is the amount of money that information technology (IT) giant Accenture Plc has splurged on acquisitions.

What makes those figures all the more remarkable is the fact that Accenture has spent more money on acquisitions in the past three years than the combined amount that India’s two most acquisitive IT outsourcing firms, Wipro Ltd and Infosys Ltd, have spent on buyouts and strategic investments ever since they started out.

The huge gulf in spending between Accenture and India’s two most high-profile IT firms—as well as others, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and HCL Technologies Ltd—underlines how global outsourcing and consulting firms have gone all out with their bets on newer technologies and the so-called “digital” revolution, and, in the process, leapfrogged Indian IT services firms, which have largely been risk-averse in their approach towards buyouts, according to tech industry executives and analysts.

In the past three years, Accenture has significantly invested in building a strong digital agency in Accenture Interactive, and scaled up business from cyber security and cloud computing—all the three technology areas currently account for three-fourths of the company’s $18 billion digital business.

Which also means that the size of Accenture’s digital business is now almost as large as the combined revenues of Infosys and Wipro.

Till about five years ago, the narrative was vastly different.

India’s top outsourcing firms, led by TCS, were on a roll. According to data from top outsourcing advisory firms, including ISG, the likes of TCS, Infosys, HCL and US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, were successfully snatching major outsourcing contracts away from incumbent giants such as IBM, HP and even Accenture, to a certain extent.

So, what really changed over the past five years?

Experts tracking the sector point to a systematic overhaul of strategy from Accenture and a simultaneous slowdown in risk appetite from large Indian IT firms as being the two primary factors that have swung the tide in a decisive way over the past five years.

Accenture’s juggernaut

Accenture’s approach towards acquisitions varied widely from that of its peers in India’s more than $150 billion IT industry—the tech giant has used each of its 70 small acquisitions and treated them like research and development (R&D) investments.

Over the past three years, these 70 companies together have brought in $1.52 billion in incremental revenue—again, that’s more than the combined incremental revenue from acquisitions of Infosys and Wipro during the same period.

During that period, Accenture managed to shore up its digital revenue to $18 billion, or more than half of $34.85 billion of overall revenue at the end of August 2017, compared with $5 billion, or 17% of its total business at the end of August 2014.

Beginning September 2014 until August 2017, at least 30 companies bought by Accenture are in the areas of cyber security, cloud computing and ad firms, according to an analysis by MintAsia.

Fifty-six of the 70 companies acquired are in the areas of design, social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing, cybersecurity and Internet of Things that Accenture calls as part of “new revenue” or classified as “digital”, the fuzzy and umbrella term which each company uses uniquely.

Accenture Interactive, the marketing subsidiary that was set up in 2009, generated $4.4 billion, or one-third of the company’s $13.2 billion, in digital revenue for the year ended August 2016.

Although Accenture declined to share the latest revenue number of its Interactive business, analysts estimate Accenture Interactive to have grown similar to in 2016 (50% year-on-year growth), largely on account of 10 companies bought in calendar year 2017. This will translate into Accenture Interactive’s revenue to be at least $6 billion, or one-third of company’s $18 billion digital revenue, for the year ended August 2017.

Last year, Accenture, which follows a September-August financial year, bought a dozen companies to scale up business from cybersecurity and cloud computing.

Revenue from cloud computing totalled $6.5 billion last year as against the $2 billion at the end of August 2014, while cybersecurity’s revenue stood at $1.2 billion.

Accenture Interactive, cybersecurity and cloud business, has clearly emerged as one of the three growth engines for Accenture, which grew 6% to end fiscal 2017 with $34.85 billion in revenue.

The company’s top management claimed that its business from digital and newer technologies totalled $18 billion—a 260% jump from 2014 when digital revenue was $5 billion.

Which would mean that Accenture’s overall digital business is now roughly the size of TCS’s overall annual business.

Accenture Interactive alone has bought 20 agencies in marketing services since it was set up in September 2009. In 2017 alone, it bought 10 such companies.

So, how does Accenture manage to integrate its small acquisitions? The company declined to offer a comment for this story, but post-earnings management interaction with analysts offers insights.

“[I]n order to rotate to the New, we had to activate this evolving strategy of making more acquisitions to get to talent we couldn’t develop organic, and we had to bring from the market. Then the big question is how do you integrate and how do you manage the culture. ..[W]e developed this concept, which might be perceived as extremely simple, but is more certainly profound than it sounds like, which is at Accenture we are developing a culture of cultures,” chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Pierre Nanterme told analysts on 28 September after the firm declared its four-quarter earnings.

Risk-averse strategy

While the firm was going all-out building its digital capabilities, as well as its marketing business, its other global peers, especially Indian outsourcing firms, were struggling to shed their reliance on traditional outsourcing services.

While on paper and at press conferences, top CEOs in Indian IT acknowledged the disruption from newer technologies, few firms actually ended up putting their money where their mouths were.

And that reflected in their vastly different approach—and attitude—towards acquisitions.

“The problem with India’s top IT firms has been that none of them have truly managed to perfect the art of integrating acquired companies within their organizations—even more so when you look at the recent start-up investments these firms have made. The problem with such investments is that companies like Infosys and Wipro don’t have full control over the IP of the ventures that they backed, and as a result, could not leverage them fully to their advantage,” said a Mumbai-based analyst at a multinational brokerage firm.

The broader reluctance of Indian IT firms to go all-out and acquire companies is possibly one reason why homegrown technology firms continue to struggle to shore up revenue from digital technologies—even as globally, firms across industries are cutting their spending on legacy outsourcing work such as software development and maintenance.

Some like TCS have followed an approach of building everything from scratch—in sharp contrast to the strategy adopted by Accenture.

“All of us (Indian IT firms), including TCS, are not even looking at this opportunity in using analytics and mobility platforms to get revenue from marketing teams. This is something which Accenture got into early through Accenture Interactive, and is now the dominant player in the space. Why are we (TCS) not buying companies? I guess it is just not in the DNA of the company as we are too risk averse,” said a senior executive at TCS, on the condition of anonymity.

Another Infosys executive also largely conceded that Indian IT firms still have a long way to go before they can replicate the success of Accenture.

“So far, our acquisition track record over the past few years has been mixed—but while they have not reflected in our numbers, we still have managed to offer our clients the best of all the technologies from our ecosystem of partners. I don’t think we’ve lagged any of our peers on that front,” said an Infosys executive, who requested anonymity.

Breaking down the numbers

Over the past five years, Wipro has spent $605 million in buying cloud services firm Appirio Inc.; Designit, a Denmark-based design firm, and picking up a 16% stake in Harte Hanks a US-based digital marketing services firm.

Additionally, parent Wipro, through Wipro Ventures, its $100-million corporate venture arm, has made investments of undisclosed size to pick up minority stakes in three cybersecurity-focused start-ups.

HCL Technologies has spent $1.72 billion over the past three years, including $1.1 billion to acquire a bunch of intellectual properties from heavyweights such as IBM and DXC Technology Co.

Although HCL Tech claims these investments will allow the company to future-proof its business, many analysts call it risky investments in legacy technologies, with HCL Tech looking to merely shore up revenue as much of the business is tied to dated technologies it has invested in.

Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer and board member at Wipro, indicated that the company had integrated all its recent acquisitions successfully and has not shied away from taking calculated risks.

“There is no ‘standard’ approach to integration. Our post-merger integration strategy depends on various factors, including the relative size of the acquired business and the corresponding business at Wipro, brand permission with customers, the culture of the acquired company and the critical talent retention strategy, among others. Sometimes we retain the acquired company’s way of working, but invariably, we tightly align the sales and marketing activities of both organizations,” said Premji.

Premji also indicated that Wipro’s venture arm had actually ended up giving the company a strategic advantage against other peers.

“We continue to look for acquisition targets, which can drive accelerated growth for Wipro, and invest in areas that are of strategic importance. Wipro Ventures provides us an additional opportunity to invest in new-age companies and build an ecosystem of partners, which is vital when we take a complete suite of offerings to the customer. Both complement each other,” said Premji.

At TCS, new CEO Rajesh Gopinathan denied that the company’s acquisition strategy had been “insular”, but appeared to concede that the Indian outsourcing market leader needs to shed its risk-averse tag.

“I don’t know if insular would be the right word, but definitely we believe in building talent and technologies in-house,” chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan said in an interview late last year.

Over the past three years, TCS’s acquisition track record has not been much to boast about. TCS last invested $50 million in stitching together a joint venture partnership with Mitsubishi Corp. in Japan in 2014.

“I agree it is a risk,” added Gopinathan, when asked if the company runs the risk of slow growth as building both technology and talent takes time. “We are betting on our people that this culture is the more robust and resilient culture that will allow us to go over multiple cycles of technology. Otherwise, I am merely a financial investment engine.”

The best of the rest

While the likes of TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Tech have struggled to extract the maximum value from mergers and buyouts, US-based Cognizant has had a relatively larger degree of success on that front.

In fact, Cognizant’s merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy has to a lesser extent mirrored that of Accenture, according to analysts tracking the sector.

Taking a leaf out of Accenture’s playbook, Wipro earlier this month created the role of global cultural officer, naming Chris Barbin, formerly with Appirio, to the post.

“He will now head ‘Culture Works’, an initiative to help better define, prioritize and enhance the culture and ways of working within Wipro to enhance agility, productivity and team-centric thinking across the organization. In this new role, Chris will report to Saurabh Govil, president and chief human resources officer, Wipro,” said a spokeswoman for Wipro.

Experts tracking the sector said that Indian IT firms will have to overhaul their existing M&A strategies if they are serious about their intention of building out meaningful new businesses from emerging technologies.

“At the heart of it, Accenture Interactive is a design-agency-meets-technology-services firm. This is the original Sapient Razorfish model,” said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “Accenture has had a more mature approach to M&A. They have a constant stream of acquisitions as buyer preferences have changed and skill sets have changed. The result—they bought demand and supply through acquisitions.”

And while Wipro’s incremental revenues from acquisitions is still yet to impress in a meaningful way, Wang feels Wipro has shown more appetite for risk than other Indian IT peers.

“Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date. (Wipro) has been more deliberate, whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities, along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play... Wipro’s purchase of Designit and Appirio with TopCoder have had an impact with clients who are seeking to get to the creative side of innovation and designing new solutions. Cognizant was early to use this approach.”

In contrast, Wang added that Infosys “has slowed down M&As and venture activities”—a case in point being the lack of big acquisitions in recent years and the recent exits from at least three start-up investments that the company has made over the past four years.

New Delhi: India is unlikely to be granted an exemption from the higher tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium imposed by the US—its name is missing from a list of probable partner countries the US is considering for a reprieve.

During a briefing to the House of Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said his office is actively discussing exemptions at the request of the European Union (EU), Australia and Argentina, and similar talks are expected with a “great number” of other nations, including Brazil, for a possible exemption from the tariff hikes.

So far, US president Donald Trump has announced that Canada and Mexico, two of its closest allies will be exempted from the tariff hike.

“I believe that countries will get out as we come to agreement, that some countries will be in a position where the duties will not apply to them in the course of the negotiation,” he said.

India’s commerce secretary Rita Teaotia last week said India is quite surprised and disappointed by the US decision to include it in the list of countries that will face higher tariffs on their exports of steel and aluminium though it is not a major exporter of these items to the US. “Since the tariffs have been imposed on security grounds and some of the key trading partners have been excluded from that, on the basis of India’s strategic partnership with the US, we are certainly not a security threat to the US. So exemption to India should also be available on the same ground,” she added.

Commerce minister Suresh Prabhu has said his ministry will seek an exemption bilaterally.

What makes an exemption for India more unlikely is a 14 March statement by House Ways and Means Committee chairman and Republican Kevin Brady after the US challenged India’s export subsidy programmes at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

“In responding to India’s prohibited subsidization of its steel industry in this manner, we prove the significance of the WTO dispute settlement process as a powerful, valuable, and appropriate tool in the Administration’s toolbox to address unfair practices that hurt our steel workers and companies. I join the Administration in calling on India to end its unfair trading immediately,” he added.

India, the world’s 14th-largest steel exporter, exported iron and steel worth $320 million and aluminium worth $350 million to the US in 2016-17. The US ranked seventh as a destination for India’s steel exports, accounting for 5% of exports.

Kolkata: Blue Star Ltd on Thursday said it will abandon its yet-to-be-built factory for manufacturing room air-conditioners in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) if it does not receive tax benefits committed earlier by the administration.

According to joint managing director B. Thiagarajan, the company has already written to the state government seeking clarity over tax benefits.

“We plan to or will exit Jammu if the benefits are not available,” Thiagarajan said, pointing out that Blue Star as a public limited company is answerable to its shareholders.

In 2016, Blue Star took land on lease in Jammu after being told that even after the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), tax concessions will continue in some form.

Earlier, Cenvat benefit of 14% was the key attraction for companies to set up manufacturing facilities in Jammu and Kashmir. Blue Star also has manufacturing facilities in Himachal Pradesh, one of which was constructed in 2005 and enjoyed tax breaks for 10 years. The other was started in 2011.

Under the GST regime, consuming states are at an advantage over manufacturing states. Jammu and Kashmir’s consumption is less than 5% of its total production.

According to Thiagarajan, while the central government is ready to compensate partly, the Jammu and Kashmir government is unlikely to make up the difference. He said a letter has been sent to the state government, saying that the company will wait till 31 March for clarity to emerge.

“We can’t wait any longer,” he said. The cost of execution is estimated to have gone up by at least 12% since the project was conceived. The company does not have capacity constraint till the summer of 2019, but will have to make alternative plans to meet demand in 2020.

Since taking the land on lease in Jammu, Blue Star has spent around Rs3 crore on designs and site development.

The company had acquired another plot at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh to double capacity for manufacturing room air-conditioners from 550,000 units per annum to 1.1 million units by 2020.

With the Jammu plan almost shelved, the company would focus entirely on its new factory in Andhra Pradesh. An investment of Rs220 crore was earlier planned for the two new facilities combined.

The construction of the factory in Andhra Pradesh, where most of the budgeted investment will be pumped in, will start by the middle of 2018 and the first phase would be completed by December 2019.

With a turnover of Rs4,400 crore in 2016-17, the company would fund its expansion entirely from internal accruals, Thiagarajan said. The room air-conditioner segment is the highest contributor at one-third of the company’s total revenue, followed by commercial refrigeration.

On Thursday, Blue Star shares fell 0.92%, or Rs7.05, to Rs760.50 on BSE while the benchmark Sensex lost 0.39%, or 129.91 points, to end the day at 33,006.27.",Blue Star puts J&K plant on hold over tax breaks,"['lease', 'puts', 'company', 'blue', 'tax', 'thiagarajan', 'jammu', 'manufacturing', 'jk', 'hold', 'room', 'plant', 'pradesh', 'breaks', 'star']","In 2016, Blue Star took land on lease in Jammu after being told that even after the implementation of the GST, tax concessions will continue in some form.

New Delhi: The government is planning to come up with a long-term strategy to secure data on Indians, especially those using social media. Information and technology and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday met top officials of the IT ministry to discuss the plan, said a person aware of the development.

The move comes after information on more than 50 million Facebook users were allegedly accessed without their consent by London-based analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm is accused of harvesting private data from millions of Facebook profiles to influence and identify voter behaviour in the US elections.

A draft data protection framework is expected to be released by the IT ministry in a couple of months which will address issues such as collection of personal data, consent of consumers, penalties and compensation, code of conduct and an enforcement model.

On Wednesday, Prasad, who is also a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson, had accused the Congress party of indulging in “theft of online data” to help with its election campaigns. He had also warned Facebook of stringent legal action if it was found misusing data on Indians.

Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), the Indian affiliate of Cambridge Analytica on Thursday denied use of any data collected from the public without their consent for any of its political analysis.

“We are equally shocked and surprised to see the data breach controversy and we are also looking to end our association with them,” Himanshu Sharma, vice-president of OBI said, according to a report from ANI.

The firm also denied having worked with Cambridge Analytica on any project related to social media.

As the war of words continued between the BJP and the Congress party, the issue escalated on Thursday with both the parties accusing each other.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked the BJP-led Union government in a tweet saying that the party has “invented story on Congress and data theft” to deflect attention from the controversy over 39 Indians dying in captivity in Iraq.

Prasad hit out at Gandhi accusing him of doing politics over dead bodies.

Both parties have said they have not used the services of Cambridge Analytica.

Srinivasan come at a time when Axis Bank’s corporate portfolio has taken a beating due to asset quality issues,"Axis Bank has seen a drastic fall in corporate loans in the recent past. Photo: Mint

Mumbai: Two top executives at Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third largest private bank, have quit, two people aware of the development said.

Sidharth Rath, head of corporate and transaction banking, and V. Srinivasan, deputy managing director, have resigned, these people said on condition of anonymity. The Mumbai-based bank has seen a drastic fall in corporate loans in the recent past.

Rath’s exit followed the hiring of S.M. Sundaresan, head of corporate banking at Standard Chartered, as head of corporate banking at Axis Bank. Rath is now likely to join Standard Chartered as head of corporate banking in Sundaresan’s place, the first of the two people said.

Rath, who has been with Axis Bank since 2001, has served in various roles such as senior vice-president, president-corporate banking, and president-transaction banking. He was instrumental in setting up the corporate and project advisory services, syndication and debt capital markets, investment banking businesses, and the formation of the transaction banking vertical, according to the bank’s website.

Srinivasan, who joined Axis Bank as executive director-corporate banking in 2009, was elevated as a director in October 2012. Earlier, he was managing director and head of markets with J.P. Morgan India. His next move is not yet known.

“As a matter of policy, Axis Bank does not comment on speculative assertions around its internal functioning,” said an Axis Bank spokesperson. A Standard Chartered spokesperson declined to comment.

“Corporate lending business is undergoing a major underwriting change. That will have a major impact on the way business is contributed in future. In that scenario, we believe management and board of Axis will be able to maintain continuity,” said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.

The resignations come at a time when Axis Bank’s corporate portfolio has taken a beating due to asset quality issues. The Reserve Bank of India’s asset quality review prompted a six-fold increase in its non-performing assets over the past two years, followed by instances of divergences in NPA disclosures, which the regulator asked the bank to make public.

Recently, RBI also imposed a fine of Rs3 crore on the bank for flouting NPA norms.

Separately, the bank is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for leakage of price-sensitive information relating to financial results on WhatsApp groups before they were officially announced.

The private bank sector has witnessed a handful of senior-level churn in corporate lending divisions.

This month, Rahul Shukla, former managing director and head of corporate banking-South Asia at Citibank, quit after a 12-year tenure and joined as head of corporate banking at HDFC Bank. Shukla has swapped the position with Balasubramanian K., who moved from HDFC Bank in November and joined Citi Bank’s South Asia Corporate Bank head.

“The corporate banking space has been traditionally dominated by PSU as well as large Indian private sector banks,” said Mukesh Bhasin, partner at domestic executive search firm Career Connect India. “Their dominance is being challenged by new and some nimbler players who don’t have legacy issues on portfolio quality and this is one of the key reasons for the talent movements happening recently,” he added.","Top Axis Bank executives Sidharth Rath, V.

The two automobile firms will co-develop a small electric car for India.

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford India Pvt. Ltd on Thursday said they have agreed to jointly develop connected vehicles, electric cars, drivetrains, compact SUVs and mid-sized SUVs.

The two companies have signed five non-binding memoranda of understanding (MoU) to cover each of the above segment, Mahindra said in a BSE filing, formalizing an alliance announced in September to co-develop a range of vehicles for India and other emerging markets.

The maker of the Scorpio SUV cited the “potential for shared investment, economies of scale, technology sharing and higher efficiencies in areas like product development and sourcing as also in new emerging growth areas of electrification and connected vehicles.”

The announcement is the next step in the collaboration between Mahindra and Ford, Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka said in the filing.

“Both teams are working together on joint development areas in keeping with industry requirements and leveraging (our) mutual strengths. We are excited about the synergies unveiled through this collaboration and the potential opportunities it will bring”, he added.

Specifically, the two automakers will co-develop a small electric car. On 9 October, Mint reported that Mahindra would share its affordable EV technologies with Ford, which the American company plans to use in its small entry-level cars such as Figo and Aspire.

The report also said Mahindra was in early talks with Ford to procure a vehicle platform Ka on which the Mumbai-based company aims to build an all-new electric sedan.

Meanwhile, a mid-sized SUV—built on the Mahindra platform—will be sold independently by both companies with their individual badging. Mahindra and Ford also agreed to assess the co-development of a compact SUV, in addition to sharing their powertrain portfolios whereby Mahindra will supply powertrains to Ford to extend the latter’s limited product range in India and its neighbouring countries.

Aiming to leverage the benefits of Ford’s global reach and Mahindra’s scale in India, teams from both companies will work together for up to three years, to assess the possibility of increasing support for Mahindra in global emerging markets via Ford’s manufacturing and distribution network, in addition to evaluating future mobility needs.

“Listening to our customers and incorporating their future needs is the core premise of this collaboration”, said Jim Farley, executive vice-president and president of global markets at Ford Motor Co.

“With utility vehicles and electrification as key focus areas, we are glad to see the progress our two companies have made”, he added.

Mahindra’s proclivity for collaboration is apparent in its past joint ventures with other global automakers such as Renault SA and Navistar International Corp. However, these alliances either fell through, as did the JV with Ford in 1998, or did not result in significant benefits for the company.

Analysts don’t expect an outcome much different this time around.

“No material outcome is expected from these MoUs for markets to take note of, since Mahindra has worked with a lot of JV partners in the past but has not been able to gain a differentiated foothold either in the PV or UV (passenger vehicle or utility vehicle) space. Competition has especially gone far ahead lately. The company has also been struggling in India with electric cars since they bought Reva (in 2010). This will be exacerbated by the fact that India doesn’t have a concrete EV policy at the moment”, said Mahantesh Sabarad, head-retail research at SBI Cap Securities.

A strong manufacturing foothold outside India will help facilitate the company’s cause; this can be done by leveraging Ford’s numerous facilities across Latin America, Europe and Asia through Mahindra’s Korean subsidiary Ssangyong (Motor Co.), Sabarad added.

On Thursday, Mahindra and Mahindra shares fell 2.14%, or Rs15.95, to Rs729.80 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex lost 0.39%, or 129.91 points, to end the day at 33,006.27.","Mahindra, Ford sign 5 deals to develop electric vehicles, SUVs","['india', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'global', 'sign', 'areas', 'suvs', 'deals', 'companies', 'vehicle', 'develop', 'mahindra', 'collaboration', 'ford']","Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford India Pvt.

New Delhi: Vodafone India and Idea Cellular Ltd, which are in the process of a merger, on Thursday outlined the key leadership team which will head the merged entity.

Kumar Mangalam Birla will be the non-executive chairman of the Vodafone-Idea combine. Balesh Sharma, who is currently the chief operating officer (COO) of Vodafone India, has been as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged entity.

Akshaya Moondra, currently chief financial officer at Idea Cellular, will be the CFO and Ambrish Jain, currently deputy managing director at Idea, will take over as COO of the merged entity, a statement from Vodafone Group Plc said.

Both Moondra and Jain will report to Balesh Sharma, who will be responsible for the combined business’s strategy and its execution as well as driving integration.

Mint had on 10 February reported that Birla may be appointed as the chairman of the Vodafone-Idea combine.

“Vodafone and Idea continue to make good progress in securing the required regulatory approvals for the merger...and completion is expected to be in the first half of the current calendar year,” the statement said.

The merged entity is yet to receive the final approval from the department of telecommunications. It has already received approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

The Vodafone-Idea merger, aimed at dominating a market that Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd had disrupted with free voice calls and low data tariffs, will create the world’s second largest and India’s largest telecom firm in terms of subscribers, overtaking Bharti Airtel Ltd.

The existing leadership teams of Idea Cellular and Vodafone India will continue to manage their separate businesses and be accountable for each company’s operational performance until the merger becomes effective, the statement said. The two will cease to operate as distinct and competing entities only upon completion of the merger.

Manish Dawar, currently CFO of Vodafone India, will have overall responsibility for integration planning, governance and execution. Nick Gliddon, currently director, Vodafone Business Services, at Vodafone India, will head the enterprise business of the merged entity.

Sashi Shankar, currently chief marketing officer at Idea, will head the marketing and brand strategy while Vishant Vora, currently chief technology officer of Vodafone India, will assume responsibility for networks and overall technology strategy.

Vodafone India’s HR head Suvamoy Roy Choudhury would continue in the same role for the merged entity, and Prakash Paranjape, currently chief information officer at Idea Cellular, will be responsible for IT operations.

Kavita Nair, who is associate director (commercial operations) at Vodafone India, will lead digital transformation across all functions. Navanit Narayan, chief service delivery officer at Idea Ceullar, will be incharge of strategy. P. Balaji, Vodafone India’s head of regulatory, external affairs and CSR, will have the same role in the merged entity.

Vodafone India’s general counsel Kumar Das will lead the legal function. Rajesh Srivastava, chief commercial officer at Idea, will hold charge of the procurement function of the combined businesses.

Idea’s head of corporate affairs Rajat Mukherjee and head of technology Anil Tandon would be full-time advisers to the merged business in their respective areas of expertise.

Vodafone India CEO Sunil Sood will join Vodafone Group Plc’s Africa, Middle East & Asia-Pacific leadership team. Aditya Birla Group intends to nominate Himanshu Kapania, currently the CEO of Idea Cellular, as non-executive board member of the merged entity, the statement added.

The Idea-Vodafone merger, announced in March 2017, is based on equal rights and equal shareholding between Idea’s promoters and Vodafone. To achieve this, Vodafone has kept its 42% stake in Indus Towers Ltd, valued at around $5 billion, out of the deal’s purview. It can also contribute Rs2,500 crore more net debt than Idea into the merged entity.

On 4 January 2018, the promoters of Idea Cellular said they will invest Rs3,250 crore into the firm. As a result of a change in Idea’s shareholding following the fundraising, Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone agreed the former will buy a minimum of 2.5% of the merged entity from Vodafone, or such stake as is required in order for it to ultimately own at least 26% of the merged entity, Vodafone said in a statement then.

Consequently, Vodafone will receive minimum proceeds of Rs1,960 crore from such a sale and Vodafone’s ownership in the combined entity is expected to be approximately 47.5% at completion.

The two companies also await the closure of the deal with ATC Telecom Infrastructure Pvt.

Mumbai: A day after rejecting bids from Numetal Mauritius Ltd and ArcelorMittal, lenders to Essar Steel Ltd reiterated they were not planning to invite new bidders for the debt-laden company, according to two people familiar with the development.

Only those who had submitted expressions of interest (EoI) in the initial round of bankruptcy auction will be allowed to participate in fresh bidding.

The EoIs were submitted by Tata Steel Ltd, Numetal Mauritius, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., Vedanta Group, Arcelor Mittal and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL).

“Lenders believe that inviting new bidders will result in repeating the entire diligence process which may lead to missing the 29 April deadline for completing the IBC process,” said one of the bankers cited earlier.

“Also, it’s important to keep new bidders outside to maintain the sanctity of the process,” the banker added.

Mint had reported on Wednesday that JSW Steel Ltd may bid for the stressed asset if lenders permits new bidders. JSW has submitted a letter to the insolvency resolution professional showing interest in the bidding process.

“If the firm is not allowed to bid in the fresh round, it will consider joining hands with other eligible bidders who have already submitted EOIs,” said another person close to the development.

A JSW Steel spokesperson declined to comment.

On Wednesday, the committee of creditors decided to reopen bidding after declaring Arcelor Mittal and Numetal Mauritius ineligible under Section 29 (a) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code.

The clause bars wilful defaulters, defaulters whose dues had been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) for more than a year, and all related entities of these firms from participating in the resolution process.

In Arcelor Mittal’s case, the firm had a stake in Uttam Galva Steel Ltd, a delinquent borrower, while in Numetal’s case, one of its minority shareholders is owned by a trust that has Rewant Ruia, son of Essar Group’s co-founder as a beneficiary.

“Both companies will have to make themselves eligible before they can submit fresh bids,” said the first banker.

“Arcelor will have to declassify themselves as a promoter of Uttam Galva whereas VTB will have to drop Rewant Ruia as consortium partner to be to be eligible to bid,” he added. VTB is the largest shareholder of Numetal.

On Wednesday, before the creditor panel arrived at its decision, Numetal filed a petition at the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to determine its eligibility as a resolution applicant. The firm said the creditor panel decision would be subject to the order passed by the court.

New Delhi: India largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd Thursday said it has raised its stake in its joint venture in Colombia from the existing 51% to 68%.

Consequently, the stake held by partner Woven Holdings LLC has declined to 32%.

The joint venture, HMCL Colombia SaS, was formed in 2014 and Hero MotoCorp owned a controlling stake through its wholly owned subsidiary, HMCL Netherlands BV, for sale, distribution and marketing of its products in Colombia.

Hero MotoCorp opened its fifth overseas manufacturing capacity—its first in Columbia—to cater to demand from the neighbouring Latin American countries and to set up a base for exports outside India.

“Pursuant to subsequent investment by HMCL B.V. into the share capital of the JV, the equity interests/shareholding of the joint venture partners in the JV have been re-aligned whereby the company’s equity interest/shareholding in the JV (through HMCL B.V.) has increased to 68%, on a fully diluted basis, from 51%,” the firm said in a press release.

The Colombia facility was the first step by the firm to expand its footprints, especially in the South and North American markets.

According to a report by news agency PTI, the manufacturing capacity was built over a project cost of $70 million, of which $38million was used in capital expenditure and the rest as working capital.",Hero MotoCorp raises stake in Colombia joint venture,"['motocorp', 'raises', 'bv', 'colombia', 'joint', 'venture', 'hmcl', 'hero', 'jv', 'stake', 'owned']","HMCl Colombia SaS was formed in 2014 with Hero MotoCorp holding a controlling stake in it through its wholly owned subsidiary HMCL Netherlands BV.

Bengaluru: Online retailer Jabong, which was bought by Flipkart in 2016, has raised service levels and expects to 25% higher gross merchandise value in the year ending 31 March.

Jabong’s net promoter score (NPS), a key measure of customer satisfaction, has risen to more than 50 from 37 last year partly because of faster and more consistent product deliveries, Myntra chief executive Ananth Narayanan said in an interview. Currently, more than 80% of Jabong’s orders are delivered by Myntra Logistics and Ekart, Flipkart’s logistics service, up from 10% six months ago.

The improvement in Jabong’s NPS has also helped the company grow revenues as well as increase its user base by 30% this financial year compared with the previous year. In the year ended March 2017, Jabong had reported a decline of 16% in revenues.

Flipkart owns Myntra and Jabong, both of which are overseen by Narayanan.

“We’ve integrated the supply chain fully. Myntra Logistics and Ekart are much better than the logistics service Jabong was using before. So that’s caused both the NPS to go up and costs to come down. We’ve also integrated the tech stack so you have two different platforms running on the same tech stack. That’s very important for us because Jabong’s previous tech system couldn’t handle the spike during the big sale events,” Narayanan said.

Flipkart bought Jabong from Rocket Internet in July 2016 for $70 million in cash. When they were separate platforms, Jabong and Myntra were arch-rivals. Some analysts have speculated that Myntra would shut down Jabong after buying it. But Narayanan has maintained that Jabong and Myntra have their own niches and appeal to differing customers.

“The overlap with Jabong and Myntra is still only 30%—the number hasn’t increased since we bought Jabong. There were three big differences between Jabong and Myntra. One, Jabong was more premium. Two, it is more metro focused. Three, it has a higher percentage of women customers. All these three have continued. Also, online penetration of fashion is still only 4% which we’re increasing. So we’re not taking share from each other. In all the consumer research we’ve done it’s come out that people like having choice of platforms,” Narayanan said.

Myntra and Jabong have turned out to Flipkart’s best acquisitions. The two specialty retailers have helped Flipkart build a monopoly in online fashion sales that arch-rival Amazon India has been unable to break despite throwing hundreds of crores of rupees in expanding its fashion business.

Jabong head Gunjan Soni said the company will continue to sharpen the differences between the platforms. Jabong will launch two in-app stores next quarter, for designer and luxury products. It will also offer faster product deliveries and concierge services.

“Given the large metro share of Jabong we’re looking at offering one-day and two-day deliveries as a guarantee. Today, while we attempt to have a large share of deliveries in one days and two days, we want to make it a promise. Another service we’re looking at is concierge services that we want to offer along with our luxury and designer purchases. So it would be by-appointment, where we would have a professional come to your house and give you complete advice on your purchases,” Soni said.","Jabong raises service levels, expects 25% higher gross merchandise value in FY18","['narayanan', 'gross', 'tech', 'raises', 'logistics', 'value', 'fy18', 'deliveries', 'higher', 'merchandise', 'expects', 'jabong', 'platforms', 'service', 'jabongs', 'share', 'levels', 'myntra']","Currently, more than 80% of Jabong’s orders are delivered by Myntra Logistics and Ekart, Flipkart’s logistics service, up from 10% six months ago.

Mumbai: Kottaram Agro Foods, a Bengaluru-based packaged foods start-up that markets its products under the brand ‘Soulfull’, has raised Rs35 crore (approximately $5.3 million) from Aavishkaar Bharat Fund, an impact investment fund of the Aavishkaar-Intellecap Group.

Founded in 2011, Kottaram Agro Foods works with state governments and research institutions which cater to the increasing number of Indians who are shifting to more healthy lifestyles.

The company processes Ragi (finger millet) into various breakfast and snack options such as flakes, Ragi bites, muesli and ready-to-cook oat-millet meals. Soulfull is also launching Smoothix, a healthy drink made out of 12 natural grains, marking its entry into the beverages category.

“There are immense opportunities in the packaged foods industry in India which is growing rapidly at 20-25%.

New Delhi: The Interpol has sought additional information from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) about diamond traders Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi in connection with the over Rs13,000 crore PNB fraud, as part of the process to issue a red corner notice (RCN) against them.

A red corner notice (RCN) is issued to seek the location and arrest of wanted persons for extradition or similar lawful action in a criminal case probe. Once an RCN is issued, the Interpol seeks to arrest the person concerned in any part of the world and notifies that country to take his or her custody for further action at their end.

People with direct knowledge of the development said Interpol asked CBI why it wanted an arrest warrant against Modi and Choksi. CBI told Interpol that the two are required for taking forward the criminal investigation launched against them on money-laundering charges, and not for a court trial.

While CBI had furnished these details in its application to the Interpol some time ago, the global body still had some queries, they said.

The CBI had sought an Interpol warrant against the two diamond traders based on a Mumbai court-issued non-bailable warrants against them in a case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

A special court in Mumbai had issued the non-bailable warrants early this month on the request of the Enforcement Directorate. The ED had earlier issued summonses to Modi and Choksi asking them to appear before it in Mumbai. However, both of them expressed their inability to depose citing business engagements and that their passports were revoked by the government.","PNB fraud: Interpol seeks more info on Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi","['mehul', 'interpol', 'mumbai', 'fraud', 'issued', 'cbi', 'arrest', 'seeks', 'info', 'warrants', 'modi', 'nirav', 'choksi', 'rcn', 'pnb', 'warrant']","Billionaire jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi are at the centre of the $2 billion PNB fraud.

New Delhi/Pokhran: India today successfully test fired the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with an indigenous seeker at Rajasthan’s Pokhran test range, enhancing the country’s capability to hit enemy targets at a range of up to 400km.

Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the BrahMos missile hit the target with “pin-point” accuracy and the success will further bolster India’s national security.

Thursday was the first time that the BrahMos missile, capable of travelling at speeds of up to Mach 3.0, or three times the speed of sound, was tested with indigenously developed seeker technology. The seeker—developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO)—determines the accuracy of a missile by guiding it to the target, officials said.

“Formidable Supersonic Cruise Missile #BrahMos was successfully flight tested at 8:42 AM today at Pokhran test range, Rajasthan. The precision strike weapon with Indian-made seeker flew in its designated trajectory and hit the target with pin-point accuracy,” Sitharaman tweeted.

The defence minister congratulated the DRDO for the successful test of the missile, saying it will further enhance India’s national security. The test firing comes three months after the BrahMos cruise missile was successfully test fired from the Indian Air Force’s frontline Sukhoi-30 MKI combat jet.

In a statement, the defence ministry said the flight test was conducted by the scientists of DRDO and BrahMos along with the Indian Army. A high-level team led by DRDO chairman Dr S. Christopher was present during the flight trial, which included director general (missiles & strategic systems) and scientific adviser to the defence minister, G. Satheesh Reddy, and BrahMos Director General Sudhir Mishra.

Senior IAF officials also witnessed the successful launch of the tactical weapon.

BrahMos is a joint venture between DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyenia of Russia. The name BrahMos is formed from the names of two rivers: the Brahmaputra of India and the Moskva of Russia.

The range of the BrahMos missile, an Indo-Russia joint venture, can be extended to up to 400 km as certain technical restrictions were lifted after India became a full member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) last year.

BrahMos missile is the heaviest weapon to be deployed on India’s Su-30 fighter aircraft. Work has already begun to integrate the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile on 40 Sukhoi combat aircraft which is expected to fulfil the critical needs of the Indian Air Force in the wake of evolving security dynamics in the region.

New Delhi: Hit hard by the Rs13,000 crore scam perpetrated by billionaire Nirav Modi, the Punjab National Bank (PNB) has decided to tighten loan disbursement and set up a monitoring mechanism to check loan slippages and fraud.

Some of the ideas being considered include having a separate pre-sanction appraisal and post sanction monitoring teams for credit disbursal to ensure better governance and transparency, people aware of the matter said.

A new monitoring group will be set up to keep track of whether cash flow from projects is being used t o repay bank loans and that there are no slippages, the people quoted above said, adding that a separate vertical to be created for stressed asset recovery. This will be tried out as a pilot in some branches before a roll out nationally in the next 6 months, the people added.

These changes are being made as part of Mission Parivartan drive which the bank launched earlier this week.

In a bid to improver customer convenience, people said, automating customer response mechanism is to be implemented soon so as to ensure timely intervention and evaluate performance on timely resolution of customer disputes and complaints across branches.

The bank is also actively looking to leverage benefits of emerging technology including AI and analytics both from a greater control over the audit process as well as providing a one stop suite of financial services with a single touch point, the people said.

Advocate Rajeev Dhawan, who argued for the Sunni Wakf Board, said there could not be a directive saying that a particular mosque was essential to the practise of Islam and the other not.

New Delhi:Saying that only a mosque or temple of “extreme significance” will be protected is wrong and in effect reduces the scope of Article 25 (freedom of religion) of the Constitution, said Rajeev Dhawan before the top court as he argued for the Sunni Wakf Board in the Ram Janmabhoomi/Babri Masjid dispute.

“A mosque is a mosque forever,” argued Dhawan on Friday. “Can one say that it loses its significance if it is destroyed? You can’t. It will remain so until an acquisition takes place,” he added.

Every religious structure is of equal significance and it would be incorrect to adopt a “comparative approach to determine whether or not it is essential to a particular religion or not”, he said.

Dhawan was making submissions before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by chief justice Dipak Misra as it considered whether the law laid down in a 1994 judgement needed to be revisited by a constitution bench.

According to him, there could not be a directive saying that a particular mosque was essential to the practise of Islam and the other not -- because of the fact that namaz can be offered anywhere.

“How is the uniqueness of a mosque or a gurdwara lost and to whom? There is no reason to treat either structure as less significant as they all hold a status that is important to their community”, he remarked.

On 24 October, 1994, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court held that offering prayers at every location would not be an “essential or integral part” of a religious practice unless the place had a particular significance for that religion, so as to have formed an essential or integral part of it.

The 1994 judgment says that a Muslim can pray anywhere, and that it does not make any difference if it is a mosque or not.

The court is hearing a total of 13 appeals filed against the 2010 judgment of the Allahabad high court in four civil suits. They challenge the high court verdict that mandated a three-way division of the disputed 2.77-acre temple/mosque site.

The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court had ruled in favour of partitioning the land equally among three parties—the Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and ‘Ram Lalla’ (infant Lord Ram), represented by the Hindu Mahasabha.

A civil suit for deciding the title of the property on which the Babri Masjid stood before it was demolished on 6 December 1992 had been filed before the high court. The apex court stayed this decision in 2011.

The Shia Central Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh told the Supreme Court in August that it is amenable to building a mosque in a Muslim-dominated area, at a reasonable distance from the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site.

It said that rather than partition the site in Ayodhya, the proposed mosque could be located at a reasonable distance from the disputed site to avoid any clashes in the future.

Mumbai:As many as 500 Air India pilots are awaiting government’s nod for the common pay structure recommended by the Dharmadhikari committee in 2012, nearly six months after the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) consented to it.

According to people familiar with the development, the IPG gave consent to the common pay structure in October 2017, following which the proposal was sent to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its approval, which is still “awaited”.

The Dharmadhikari panel had submitted its report to the government way back in January 2012, calling for common pay and allowances as per the norms for other public sector enterprises.

The IPG represents the Boeing wide-body fleet at the flag carrier. It agreed to accept the common pay structure for pilots in line with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines.

Under the common pay structure, flying allowance will be paid only in rupees and not in dollars, the IPG had said. Besides, pilots’ flying allowance hours will be reduced to 70 hours per month from 80 earlier.

However, they will be entitled to higher over-time fees. When contacted, an Air India spokesperson declined to comment, saying it is an internal policy issue. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), which represents the Airbus fleet pilots at the state-owned carrier, has long ago accepted the recommendations.

Meanwhile, Air India has decided to promote some 100 pilots to the executive rank as part of the level-mapping exercise, sources said.

“At the time of merger, a section of Air India narrow-body (erstwhile Indian Airlines) pilots got promoted. On the other hand, a section of wide-body (Air India) pilots had not got any promotion since 2007, resulting in anomalies,” they said.

The promotion of 100-odd pilots is aimed at removing such discrepancies, sources said. Once the agreement is in place, the pilots in Air India will have a uniform salary structure for both the Airbus and Boeing fleets, as per the sources.

Following the decision to merge the two airlines in 2007, various processes were to be integrated within 18-24 months, including HR. To arrive at common structure, the ministry constituted a committee of external experts under Justice Dharmadhikari.

The panel submitted its report in January 2012, which was further examined by a three-member inter-ministerial committee to suggest a time frame for implementation.

The inter-ministerial panel submitted its report in May 2012, and subsequently an implementation-cum-anomaly rectification committee was set up to implement the recommendations of the panel.",Air India pilots still waiting for govt nod for common pay structure,"['hours', 'govt', 'structure', 'flying', 'panel', 'india', 'pay', 'common', 'ipg', 'waiting', 'nod', 'air', 'pilots']","Air India pilots deboarding from an aircraft in New Delhi.

Mysuru: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of being “afraid” to face the no-confidence motion moved against it.

“In parliament, a no-confidence motion against the Modi government has been moved. For the past 10 days it has been stalled because the government is afraid,” Gandhi said at a public rally in Mysuru.

The second half of the budget session of Parliament has been a complete washout since commencement with protests from the Congress, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the YSR Congress Party on various issues stalling the proceedings.

The Congress has given a notice to move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government, becoming the third party to do so after YSRCP and TDP. With the Lok Sabha not being in order, the no-confidence motion of YSRCP and TDP have not been taken up so far. The government has stated that it was willing for a discussion on the no-confidence motion.

In his speeches almost devoted entirely to attack Modi, Gandhi targeted the government on the PNB fraud, foreign policy and Jammu and Kashmir situation. “Wherever you see around India, you would find China. You would find China in Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Maldives... Once they were India’s friends, they are now China’s friends”, he said. “On Bhutan’s land, China builds a road and a helipad and keeps a guard and the 56-inch person does not speak a word,” he said, taking a jibe at the prime minister.

On Jammu and Kashmir, Gandhi said there were terror attacks in the state but when the Congress-led UPA government came to power, it broke the spine of terrorists. Neither civilians nor soldiers were being killed, he claimed. “But for the sake of power, Modi backed the PDP to form government and ignited fire in Jammu and Kashmir... there is violence in Jammu and Kashmir and Modiji is not speaking a word”, Rahul said.

On the upcoming Karnataka elections, Gandhi said he was confident of his party winning not only the state but also the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“The Congress needs to fight harder at every single booth and defeat the BJP.I am confident that we will win Karnataka in 2018 and in the general elections in 2019,” he said. The Congress would give a tough fight to the BJP in each and every booth and give them a crushing defeat, he added.

According to Gandhi, Modi does not care for farmers’ welfare as he refused to waive off their loans. Gandhi said the fight was between two ideologies of creating conflicts and uniting the nation. “This fight is between ideologies. On one hand, we have BJP-RSS who have an ideology that creates conflict between religions and on the other hand there is the Congress whose ideology unites this nation,” he said.

At a rally in K.R. Pete, Gandhi continued his attack on the Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, and asked former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda’s party to come clean on its support to the BJP.

“JDS, they have to make it clear whether they are the BJP’s B-team or not,” Gandhi said at the meeting in the Vokkaliga belt of the old Mysuru region, considered a JDS stronghold. “They (JDS) have to make it clear whether they are supporting the BJP, if yes, why? The JDS stands for ‘Janata Dal Sangh Parivar’,” he added.

Terming employment generation the “biggest problem” in India, Gandhi attacked the BJP-led central government for “not” fulfilling the promises it had made to the people such as job creation and addressing the issue of farmer distress.

Praising the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka, the Congress president said it had worked for the poor, downtrodden and backward communities. Gandhi even credited the chief minister for running a “clean government”.

Raising the Nirav Modi issue and alleging that the diamantaire had run away with Rs22,000 crore, the Congress president questioned Modi’s silence on the matter. “What kind of chowkidaari (watchman’s job) is Narendra Modi doing,” he asked.

The Congress president is on his fourth round of campaigning for Karnataka elections. He had earlier toured the northern, coastal and Malnad regions. The Karnataka elections are likely to be held in April-May.","Modi govt ‘afraid’ of no-confidence motion, says Rahul Gandhi","['govt', 'congress', 'noconfidence', 'party', 'afraid', 'rahul', 'karnataka', 'elections', 'modi', 'president', 'kashmir', 'gandhi', 'motion']","Photo: PTIMysuru: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of being “afraid” to face the no-confidence motion moved against it.

New Delhi: A draft defence production policy put out by the government proposes to increase the foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in niche technology areas to 74% under the automatic route, in a bid to boost local manufacturing and catapult India into the league of countries housing top defence and aerospace industries.

At present, the FDI cap for the defence sector is 49% under the automatic route for all categories.

The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018, which was made public late on Thursday, aims to “create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative”.

It also aims to “facilitate faster absorption of technology and create a tiered defence industrial ecosystem in the country”, besides reducing the “dependence on imports” to “achieve self-reliance”.

India is currently the top importer of defence hardware in the world (according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been running a campaign with the goal of increasing the share of local manufacturing in the defence sector to create more jobs.

“It’s a bit ambitious in scope. The targets set will be very difficult to realize in their entirety,” said C. Uday Bhaskar, a former navy commodore and currently director of Delhi-based think tank Society for Policy Studies.

According to the policy, India hopes to achieve a turnover of Rs1.7 trillion in defence goods and services by 2025. It has a goal of becoming an arms exporter to the tune of Rs35,000 crore in defence goods and services by 2025.

By giving a leg-up to defence manufacturing, Asia’s third largest economy also hopes to transform itself into a “global leader in cyberspace and AI (artificial intelligence) technologies”.

The government is targeting achieving self-reliance in the development and manufacture of fighter aircraft, medium-lift and utility helicopters, warships, land combat vehicles, autonomous weapon systems, missiles, guns, small arms, ammunition, explosives, surveillance, electronic warfare and communication systems and night fighting equipment.

To achieve all these goals and to make it easier to do business in the area of defence for innovators, small- and medium-sized enterprises, the policy proposes to bring in enabling provisions to ensure start-ups and small enterprises participate “without having restrictions of turnover” or “prior experience”.

The government will list its requirements in terms of platforms and weapon systems for the next decade to help private sector companies understand the opportunities.

It will also simplify procedures for private firms to enter defence production, i.e., liberalize the regime by issuing licences in 30 days and pruning no-go areas to a small ‘negative list’ for licensing.

The government will also do away with capacity assessment, except for critical projects. It will introduce earnest money deposits and performance guarantees as safeguards for others.

With regard to offsets, the government has proposed to set up an ombudsman for resolving all such claims. Offsets—investments through a local partner to set up an ecosystem of suppliers—would be investment linked.

In the area of taxation, the government has proposed rationalization of taxes on import of capital goods for services and inputs for defence and aims to prevent inversion of taxes.",Draft defence production policy aims to raise FDI cap in niche tech to 74%,"['raise', 'production', 'draft', 'create', 'tech', 'fdi', 'aims', 'defence', 'india', 'small', 'services', 'systems', 'set', 'niche', 'cap', 'policy']","The Draft Defence Production Policy 2018 aims to ‘create an environment that encourages a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, as an important part of the Make in India initiative’.

New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi after allegations surfaced that data from his NaMo app was being shared without users’ consent, a charge the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trashed.

Gandhi also accused the media of “burying” the NaMo app data leak story.

Gandhi’s attack on the prime minister was based on a media report in which a French vigilante hacker has purportedly alleged that data was stolen from the NaMo app without consent of the users.

“Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India’s Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official app, I give all your data to my friends in American companies,” Gandhi said on Twitter.

In the tweet, he also attached a news story titled, Data theft allegations reaches PM Modi’s doorstep, French vigilante hacker’s stunning revelation.

The BJP reacted on Twitter saying, it did not expect “any better” from the Congress chief. It also said the data is used only for analytics using a third-party service, similar to Google Analytics.

People aware of the development said the NaMo app does not ask for blanket permissions when it is launched. They said the app is unique in nature, which unlike most apps, gives access to users in “guest mode” without even any permission or data. The permissions required are all “contextual and cause-specific”, the people pointed out.

“We also take this opportunity to encourage Rahul Gandhi to download NaMo App to keep himself appraised of the good things happening in India,” the BJP4India said in a tweet. It put out several tweets on the matter.

“Contrary to Rahul’s lies, fact is that data is being used for only analytics using third-party service, similar to Google Analytics. Analytics on the user data is done for offering users the most contextual content,” the BJP added.

“Rahul Gandhi is no match for Narendra Modi. But seeing his fright about the Namo App, is very amusing. When his bots tried to trend #DeleteNamoApp day before yesterday, the popularity and downloads of Namo App only increased,” it said.

In his tweet, Gandhi also attacked the media. “Ps. Thanks mainstream media, you’re doing a great job of burying this critical story, as always,” Gandhi tweeted.

New Delhi:Rejecting the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the National Medical Commission bill, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest body of private doctors in India, on Sunday called for an indefinite strike from 2 April.

More than 25,000 doctors from across India on Sunday held a ‘mahapanchayat’ at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in Delhi and opposed the parliament panel’s recommendations and the bill.

The NMC bill proposes to allow practitioners of alternative medicines—such as homoeopathy and ayurveda—to practice modern medicine once they complete a “bridge course”.

It also proposes that the National Licentiate Examination (NLE) be made compulsory for any MBBS doctor, including a foreign graduate, to make them eligible to practice medicine in India.

The parliamentary panel has recommended that the “bridge course” should not be made a mandatory provision. It has also suggested to integrate the NLE with the final year MBBS exam.

The doctors say the panel’s suggestions are “deceptive”. IMA national president Ravi Wankhedkar said all medical students and doctors will go on an indefinite strike on 2 April.

He said there was no need for the government to make any law if they want to boost only AYUSH, homeopathy, pharmacists and dentist.

“The PSC report is deceptive to such an extent that it will open up the floodgates to allow back-door entry to cross-pathy, thereby promoting quackery legally. Even after the cosmetic amendments, the core issues still remain where it is,” Wankhedkar said.

Declaring hospitals “safe zones” was one of the issues discussed at the mahapanchayat. Vinay Aggarwal, coordinator of the mahapanchayat, emphasized on the issue of violence against doctors and insisted that the “problems faced by doctors are enough, now it’s time to payback”.

People should understand the meaning of medical negligence and that a doctor never intends to perform a wrong surgery, the IMA said. It demanded no criminal prosecution for “minor clinical errors”. R.N. Tandon, honorary secretary-general of the IMA, said: “The NMC is a pro-private management bill paving the way for widespread corruption... All arguments of the government are hollow and its intention is malafide and harmful.”

Wankhedkar said the provisions to open new medical colleges are ambiguous and the provisions to begin PG courses are unregulated.

“Recommendation to increase the regulation of fee in private medical colleges from 40 to 50% does not make a material difference. However, lack of clarity on implementation may jeopardise the decision itself,” he added.",Indian Medical Association calls indefinite strike from 2 April over NMC bill,"['indefinite', 'indian', 'medical', 'association', 'national', 'practice', 'strike', 'bill', 'doctors', 'proposes', 'calls', 'mahapanchayat', 'nmc', 'ima', 'medicine']","Members of IMA and West Bengal Medical Council in a protest march in Kolkata on 2 January, 2018.

New Delhi: A parliamentary panel has recommended earmarking of a defined portion of proceeds from divestment of state-owned enterprises for funding revival, restructuring and modernisation proposals of sick public sector units (PSUs) that have the potential to turn around.

“In this manner, the government can extend a hand-holding support to the select sick PSUs that have the potential to turn around and sustain themselves in future,” the panel said in a report.

Besides, NITI Aayog is preparing another list of sick PSUs that can be privatised, its CEO Amitabh Kant said last month. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had asked the think-tank to look into the viability of sick state-run companies. The Aayog has already recommended strategic divestment of 40 sick public sector units.

In its report, the parliamentary standing committee on industry said it is of the firm opinion that while making a decision to disinvest PSUs, especially those that are profit making, the government must accord due consideration to the jobs supported by them, the track record of their contribution to the national economy, their capital expenditure creation potential and also their role in balancing the social/regional fabric.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday focussed on agriculture and healthcare in his Mann Ki Baat radio address—issues that have taken centre stage in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“An extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop,” Modi said, adding programmes to upgrade the infrastructure of 22,000 rural markets and integrating them with the electronic national agricultural market, or eNAM, will help local farmers connect to a global market.

“A system is being set up wherein farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect,” Modi said. He reminded farmers of last month’s budget provision fixing minimum support prices (MSPs) at a level which is at least 50% more than cost of production “to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce”.

Noting that the coming months when planting of rain-fed summer crops will begin is crucial for farmers, Modi advised them to adopt new technologies and practices learnt from the state broadcaster’s 24-hour farm channel DD Kisan. “Today, the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields. This has provided a big boost to our agro-producers,” Modi said.

The prime minister has addressed farmers twice over the past month, first at a conference on doubling farmer incomes last month, and again at the annual Krishi Unnati Mela organized by the agriculture ministry in March. The emphasis on farm sector follows mounting protests by farmers since June last year in backdrop of a collapse in wholesale crop prices amid record harvests.

“The prime minister promised the government will ensure that farmers benefit from MSP announcements but the situation on ground is entirely different,” said Avik Saha, convener of Jai Kisan Andolan, a farmer’s organization. “In an ongoing public audit in five states, we found that farmers incurred a loss of Rs14,474 crore while selling their winter harvest of pulses and oilseeds at prices lower than support prices.”

In his Mann Ki Baat address, the prime minister also underlined the importance of healthcare. “All you young people can come together to launch a movement of Fit India,” he said. The prime minister said Swachch Bharat (clean India) and Swasth Bharat (healthy India) are complementary to each other, adding all ministries are working together for preventive health.

“Preventive healthcare is the least costly and the easiest one as well. And, the more we become aware about preventive healthcare, the more beneficial will it be for individuals, the family and the society,” Modi said.“The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness. All of us took up the responsibility and the result is that in the last four years or so, sanitation coverage has almost doubled and risen to around 80%. Also, extensive work is going on to set up health wellness centres across the country.”

“It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.” He appealed to make the upcoming International Yoga Day on 21 June a success as previous three international yoga days. “Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways,” he said.

The prime minister said efforts were being undertaken to make healthcare accessible and affordable with more than 3,000 jan aushadhi (medicine) stores opened across the country and more than 800 medicines being made available there at affordable prices.

“The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85%. Knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50% to 70%. Under ‘Ayushman Bharat Yojana’, the government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide Rs lakh for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year,” he added.

The prime minister said a new AIIMS —All India Institutes of Medical Sciences—were being opened in various states. One new medical college will be set up for every three districts. In the existing 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68,000, he said.

Calling the task of making the country tuberculosis-free by 2025 an enormous one, Modi said, “Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness. All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.”","Mann ki Baat: Narendra Modi focuses on healthcare, agriculture reforms","['agriculture', 'yoga', 'india', 'ensure', 'mann', 'healthcare', 'farmers', 'narendra', 'baat', 'undertaken', 'modi', 'reforms', 'prime', 'minister', 'country', 'focuses', 'ki']","An extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop, said PM Narendra Modi in his Mann Ki Baat address.

New Delhi:The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is all set to make face authentication available alongside iris or fingerprint scan as means of verifying Aadhaar users from 1 July, 2018.

The UIDAI, which is in-charge of the 12-digit identifier Aadhaar, in January had announced that it will introduce face authentication feature to help those who run into problems in biometric authentication due to old age, hardwork or worn-out fingerprints.

It had said that face authentication will be allowed only in fusion mode meaning it would be permitted along with either fingerprint or iris or OTP to verify the details of Aadhaar holders.

In a presentation to the Supreme Court last week where he emphasised the robustness of the Aadhaar encryption system saying breaking it may take “more than the age of the universe for the fastest computer on earth”, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey also informed that the proposed face authentication feature will be introduced by 1 July.

“Face authentication shall be available in fusion mode along with one more authentication factor like fingerprint/iris/OTP from 1 July, 2018,” he had said in the power point presentation titled ‘1 billion +’.

Aadhaar is being used for identity authentication across banks, telecom companies, public distribution system, income tax amongst others and the extent of its usage can well be gauged from the fact that an average of 4 crore authentications are being done on a daily basis.

Even in his presentation, the UIDAI CEO has pointed out that 1,696.38 crore Aadhaar authentications and 464.85 crore eKYC transactions have been performed so far.

Seeking to allay concerns over government’s ambitious Aadhaar scheme, Pandey had said that UIDAI does not collect purpose, location or details of transaction.

Pandey began his presentation before the five-judge constitution bench on Thursday and is scheduled to resume it on 27 March. The bench is hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Aadhaar.",UIDAI set to introduce face authentication feature from 1 July,"['authentication', 'uidai', 'feature', 'presentation', 'age', 'introduce', 'system', 'set', 'aadhaar', 'crore', 'face', 'wornout']","UIDAI said the face authentication feature will help those who run into problems in biometric authentication due to old age or worn-out fingerprints.

Lucknow: The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of the Uttar Pradesh police has arrested ten persons, who it claimed were linked with Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) and allegedly involved in terror-funding activities.

“Ten persons were arrested from Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Pratapgarh and Rivan (MP) yesterday by the ATS. These persons were involved in terror-funding on the directives from Pakistan,” ATS IG Asim Arun told reporters here.

The arrested men were identified as Naseem Ahamad, Naeem Arshad, Sanjay Saroj, Niraj Mishra, Sahil Masih, Uma Pratap Singh, Mukesh Prasad, Nikhil Rai alias Musharraf Ansari, Ankur Rai and Dayanand Yadav, he said.

“A member of Lashker-e-Taiba used to remain in contact with them and ask them to open bank accounts in fake names and direct them as to how much money is to be transferred to which account. Indian agents used to get 10 to 20% commission for this. Till now transactions of over Rs1 crore have come to the fore,” he said.

He claimed the arrested persons had links with the LeT and some of them even knew what was happening.

“Some them clearly knew what they were doing, while some considered it as a lottery fraud,” the officer said, adding a detailed probe was on and more arrests likely. The role of the bank staff too would be probed, he said.

Photo: AFP

Washington: President Donald Trump is poised to take his most aggressive actions yet against Russia on Monday, when he’s likely to announce the expulsion of dozens of diplomats in response to the nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy living in the UK.

The move, all but certain to provoke retaliation by President Vladimir Putin’s government, comes as Trump has tried to maintain at least the semblance of a constructive relationship with the Russian leader.

But the expulsions will align Trump with European allies who feel threatened by Russia and have had a turbulent relationship with the US president, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Several European countries are expected to announce their own expulsions of Russian diplomats in concert with the US.

While US policy toward Russia has gradually grown more strident in recent months, the president’s critics say he has been slow to respond to Putin’s provocations. Some have drawn a connection to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government as well as Trump’s past business relationships with Russian figures.

‘Good Thing’

Trump has denied any campaign collusion and as recently as Wednesday advocated for an amicable relationship with Russia. “Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he said on Twitter.

The US considers the diplomats it plans to expel to be spies, carrying out intelligence activities under cover as embassy staff, one person familiar with the matter said. Trump’s action would follow a similar move by May, who ordered 23 Russians that she said were spies to leave Britain over the attack on the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter.

“The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia’s outrageous action,” White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement on Saturday. “The president is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities.”

But Putin has proven expert at exploiting even the slightest divisions among Western allies, and Trump is concerned that European capitals may not follow through on promises to tighten the screws on the Kremlin. The president regards Germany, in particular, as wobbly because of its dependence on Russian fuel supplies.

NSC Recommendations

Trump’s National Security Council reached recommendations for a US response to the UK attack at a meeting on Wednesday and presented the proposals to him on Friday. Trump discussed the issue that day with US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, FBI director Chris Wray, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, defense secretary James Mattis, director of national intelligence Dan Coats, outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster and others, two people familiar with the talks said.

All of the people who discussed the president’s deliberations asked not to be identified. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.

A division within the White House over how to confront Putin flared this week after Trump called the Russian president on Tuesday and congratulated him for winning an election regarded in the West as largely fraudulent. The praise drew criticism from Congress and ran contrary to written talking points for the call that advised Trump not to congratulate the Russian leader, a person familiar with the matter said. Trump didn’t read the guidance.

Trump meanwhile has reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations who has promoted military action against Iraq, Iran and North Korea. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.

Congress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive US measures imposed after Russia’s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington’s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump’s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin’s provocations.

Personal Relationship

The president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won’t publicly attack him, and doesn’t see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said Thursday. But Russia’s brazen aggression is compelling a US response.

The attack against Skripal employed a nerve agent called “Novichok” manufactured by the Soviet Union, according to the UK government. May earlier this month condemned Russia for the apparent assassination attempt, which critically injured the former Russian spy and his daughter. A British police officer was also hospitalized.

Regardless of Trump’s rhetoric, his administration regards the Kremlin as a threat.

A national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the US. Earlier this month, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet “troll farm” and its alleged owner—a close Putin ally—whom Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 election.

New Delhi: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering to come out with new norms on share buyback programme, under which maximum limit for share repurchase will be 25% of the company’s paid up capital and other reserves.

The company may buyback its shares and other securities from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis through the tender offer; open market via—book building process and stock exchange—and odd-lot holders, senior officials said.

This will be applicable provided that no offer of buyback for 15% of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company will be made from the open markets. The proposal will be discussed at the board meeting of Sebi this week, they added.

The regulator plans to come out with a consultation paper on the share and other securities buyback programme and seek public comments on the same. The final regulations will be put in place after taking views of all the stakeholders. Under the proposal, the maximum limit of any buyback would be 25% or less of the aggregate of paid up capital and free reserves of the company.

Besides, the ratio of the aggregate secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buyback may not be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves. According to the proposal, the company would not buyback its shares to delist its scrips, besides, the firm would not repurchase its scrips through negotiated deals, whether on or off the stock exchange through spot transactions or through any private arrangement.

“A company shall not make any offer of buyback within a period of one year reckoned from the date of closure of the preceding offer of buyback,” as per the proposal. The company may not be allowed to purchase its own shares through any subsidiary company and any investment company. Further, the firm would not directly or indirectly purchase its own shares if a default is made by it.

However, such buyback would not be prohibited if the default is remedied and period of three years has lapsed after such default ceased to subsist. If a company completes buyback of its shares, it will not make a further issue of the same kind of scrips including allotment of new shares within six months except by way of bonus issue or in the discharge of subsisting obligations such as warrants, stock option schemes and conversion of preference shares or debentures into equity shares.

The companies will have to complete their buyback offers within a period of one year of passing a special resolution by the general meeting or the special resolution passed by the board of directors.

Beijing: China pledged on Sunday to press ahead with market opening and reforms while reiterating that it will treat domestic and foreign firms equally and protect intellectual property rights.

The pledge on reform and equal treatment came from vice premier Han Zheng, at a time there are increasing prospects of a trade war with the United States.

Han, making his first speech since being named executive vice premier earlier this month, told the China Development Forum in Beijing that China needs to “open even wider to the outside world,” and would do so via its Belt and Road Initiative.

China is fully aware that economic globalisation is “irreversible,” said Han, adding that unilaterism and trade protectionism served nobody’s interests.

Also at the forum, He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said China “will deepen supply-side structural reforms and work hard to eliminate ineffective supply”.

Earlier this month, the NDRC said China, the world’s biggest steel and coal producer, would cut its annual steel capacity by around 30 million tonnes and coal capacity by about 150 million tonnes this year.

China will also promote international capacity cooperation as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which Beijing considers to be a modern-day ‘silk road’, and widen access to the Chinese market, including the financial, telecom and education sectors, He said.

Equal Protection

It will also “give equal protection to property rights of all ownership types by law,” and strengthen protection of intellectual property rights, said He, adding that China would better integrate its financial sector and real economy.

John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council told Reuters China “has been promising market-opening measures and protection of intellectual property for some time, but what the US business community is waiting for is action.”

The United States launched a complaint against China at the World Trade Organization on Friday, part of a package of trade measures announced by President Donald Trump on Thursday over China’s alleged theft of US intellectual property..

China’s ministry of commerce said on Friday it opposed US unilateralism and protectionism after Washington unveiled plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods following an intellectual property probe.

Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, who is co-chairing the forum, told the meeting the business community “has always supported the idea that open markets foster new ideas and allow entrepreneurship to thrive.”

“The strongest companies and economies are those that are open - those that thrive on diversity of people and ideas,” said Cook, who on Saturday called for “calm heads” in the brewing US-China trade dispute.

Lucknow/Gorakhpur: The RLD and the Nishad Party on Saturday expelled their MLAs for voting against party directives in the just concluded Rajya Sabha polls.

Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh expelled his lone MLA in the UP Assembly Sahender Singh Chauhan. Nishad Party president Sanjay Nishad announced the expulsion of MLA Vijay Misra.

MLA Sahendra Singh Chaudhan kept the party leadership in the dark and worked against its directives. Hobnobbing with the BJP, he cast his vote as part of a conspiracy. He has been expelled by party president Chaudhary Ajit Singh, an RLD release issued in Lucknow read.

The party had decided to vote in favour of the BSP in the Rajya Sabha elections to defeat communal forces, the release, signed by RLD national general secretary Trilok Tyagi, read.

The RLD is committed to opposition unity in national interest against the BJP government which is “spreading communal hatred in society”, it added. RLD MLA’s vote was reportedly declared invalid as he had cast it in favour of two candidates.

At a press conference in Lucknow, Mayawati said the RLD MLA did not vote in favour of the BSP nominee.

According to a report from Gorakhpur, the Nishad Party expelled dissident MLA Vijay Mishra, who represented the Gyanpur seat in the Assembly, and also cancelled his primary membership. Mishra is the only MLA of the Nishad Party and he voted in favour of the BJP during the Rajya Sabha polls.

Sanjay Nishad, the national president of the Nishad Party, announced the expulsion of the MLA for “cross-voting and indiscipline”.

Our party does politics based on ethics and ideology and cannot tolerate deceivers, Sanjay Nishad said, adding the BJP is a party of industrialists and its ideology is totally opposite.

Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen won the Gorakhpur parliamentary seat in the recently held Lok Sabha by-polls.

Bengaluru: It resembles the popular video game Super Mario. Only that this one has a small caricature of a short man with a paunch who can be moved back & forth and made to jump on slabs high up in the air. The slabs have either a closed blue fist or a orange flower like caricature.

The player makes the main character jump up, and if he successfully lands on the fist or the flower, a small explosion and you are credited with points. Another jump and the flag colour turns green with a lady with a pile of fresh harvest on her head moves on these slabs.

It’s not the new version of Super Mario though. The caricature is that of former Karnataka chief minister H.D.Kumaraswamy and the hurdles he has to jump on are constituencies, where other parties are in power, to hoist the Janata Dal (Secular) flag. The closed blue fist represents the Congress and flower depicts the BJP. The tagline is “Kumaranna for CM”.

It has points, and after completion of the on screen obstacles, the game loads the next stage after a short advertisement explaining a new scheme from its election manifesto for various sections of society.

With assembly elections due later this year, all the three major political parties—JD(S), Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) —are leaving no tool unexplored to reach out to voters. All three political parties have deployed an extensive social media strategy including online videos and digital content, each seeking support from the electorate.

Surprisingly though, JD(S), a party whose politics is centred around farmers and rural Karnataka, has made its presence felt in the online space.

The BJP had earlier released a video of with Siddaramaiah’s face on Super Mario and how the latter overcomes hurdles. As the character steps on the oncoming hurdles (like in the original game), a flash message is shown to take a dig at Siddaramaiah like how the latter has failed on his promises and how he has gotten bigger by cheating various sections of society. The very first oncoming hurdle approaches the main character is that of former Prime Minister H.D.Deve Gowda, who was Siddaramaiah’s political mentor.

JD(S) though is the first to release a game, which has a 4.9 rating on Google Play store has 200 reviews, with many hailing the leader as the next chief minister.

On the Google play store, there are at least 10 such apps with titles like Kumaranna for CM, Kumara Udyog, H.D.Kumaraswamy and Nimma HDK among others whose downloads range from 1000-10000.

“Karnataka’s first politics based 3D game,” the party said in a statement.

As the game progresses, the game goes on to Vidhana Soudha where the leader climbs various levels. The Party said that the game has been developed by Kumaraswamy’s fans.

“We are about 100 volunteers. But only about 20 worked on this game for two months,” 26 year old Chandhan Dhore, who is part of the party’s social media team said.

173,Students march across US demanding stricter gun laws after mass shootings,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/YXuyF0NJPVjmvfwtXVsneJ/Students-march-across-US-demanding-stricter-gun-laws-after-m.html,"Thousands of high school students, other gun-control advocates gathered in Washington and across the US today to demand tougher firearms restrictions after mass shootings","Washington: Thousands of high school students and other gun-control advocates gathered in Washington and across the US on Saturday to demand tougher firearms restrictions from an older generation that’s delivered little change after years of mass shootings.

Organizers said they expected more than 700,000 people to attend the March for Our Lives rally at the foot of Capitol Hill, a gathering led by survivors of the 14 February attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

The demonstration in Washington is meant to be the largest of more than 800 planned marches nationwide and overseas, according to leaders who organized under the Twitter hashtag #NeverAgain. Protesters are demanding protection from gun violence, including a ban on assault weapons such as the rifle used in Parkland, a prohibition on high-capacity magazines that let killers shoot long bursts without reloading, and more effective background checks for gun purchases.

The student organizers raised more than $3 million through an online GoFundMe campaign and worked with Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for universal background checks and other gun control measures. Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP, which operates Bloomberg News, serves as a member of Everytown for Gun Safety’s advisory board and is a donor to the group.

White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement Saturday, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.” She pointed to gun-safety actions this week by Congress and the Justice Department.

Bump stocks

Attorney general Jeff Sessions on Friday announced a proposed rule to ban so-called bump stocks that allow semi-automatic guns to fire more rapidly, similar to a fully automatic weapon. A sniper in the 1 October Las Vegas mass shooting used such a device to kill 58 concert-goers.

Congress also voted Friday to bolster background checks for gun purchases, spend more on school safety, and let the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study gun violence, ending what was in effect a 22-year ban that was supported by the National Rifle Association.

The measures — tucked into a larger spending bill signed by President Donald Trump — marked the first congressional action in years on gun legislation. But they’re small steps compared with the 1994 assault-weapons ban that lapsed in 2004. Congress seemed poised to act after the 2012 massacre of 20 six- and seven-year-olds and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, but the effort failed.

The street protests and growing congressional attention mean gun control could loom large in the November midterm elections. Democrats have embraced the issue, while Republican congressional leaders and Trump haven’t moved to adopt measures such as ending assault-weapon sales. At one point Trump said he backed comprehensive gun-control measures, but he backed off after meeting with the NRA’s top lobbyist. The president also said he wanted to allow teachers and other staff members to be armed and trained to confront shooters.

Saturday’s march follows a nationwide student walkout over gun violence on 14 March, the one-month mark since the Parkland killings. Another national walkout, organized by a different group of students, is planned for 20 April, the 19th anniversary of the 1999 attack at Colorado’s Columbine High School that killed 12 students and a teacher and left two dozen more injured.

Washington: President Donald Trump is preparing to expel dozens of Russian diplomats from the US in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.

Trump agreed with the recommendation of advisers and the expulsions are likely to be announced on Monday, the people said, though they cautioned that Trump’s decision may not be final. Trump is prepared to act but wants to be sure European allies will take similar steps against Russia before doing so, aides said.

The advisers reached recommendations for a US response to the UK attack at a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday and honed the proposals on Friday. Trump discussed the issue Friday with US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, attorney general Jeff Sessions, defence secretary James Mattis, director of national intelligence Dan Coats, outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster and others, two people said.

All of the people familiar with the discussions asked not to be identified. White House spokespeople declined to comment.

Deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah told Bloomberg on Saturday, “The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia’s outrageous action. The president is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities. We have no announcements at this time.”

Russia divisions

A battle within the White House over how to best address the provocations of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensifying. The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.

Trump has meanwhile reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favoured a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who is a staunch conservative and military hawk. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.

Congress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive U.S. measures imposed after Russia’s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington’s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump’s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin’s provocations.

Relationship priority

Trump has agreed to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won’t publicly attack him, and doesn’t see any benefit to the US in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said Thursday.

Trump defended his call with Putin on Twitter on Wednesday, dismissing those who “wanted me to excoriate him.”

“They are wrong!” Trump wrote. “Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this month condemned Russia for the nerve agent attack that critically injured the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia. A British police officer was also hospitalized. May ordered 23 Russians — who she said were undeclared spies — to leave Britain in retaliation. She has sought the cooperation of other countries in her campaign to punish Moscow.

Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said on Friday night that “the United States is considering a range of options to respond to Russia’s outrageous actions in the UK, both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements.”

She added that the State Department “doesn’t have any actions to announce today.”

Regardless of Trump’s rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.

A national defence strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the US. Earlier this month, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet “troll farm” and its alleged owner — a close Putin ally — whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 election.

Beijing: “No change” has taken place at the Dokalam standoff area after it was resolved last year, India’s envoy Gautam Bambawale said and blamed China squarely for the face off, saying it happened because Beijing tried to alter the “status quo” which it should not have.

The 73-day long standoff ended on 28 August last year after China agreed to halt the road building activities at Dokalam in Sikkim Section.

“No, I can tell you that in Dokalam area, which we call close proximity or sometimes the face off site, the area where there was close confrontation or close proximity between Indian and Chinese military troops, there is no change taking place today,” India’s Ambassador to China Bambawale said, reacting to reports of Chinese military stepping up infrastructure build-up in the area.

The Chinese side may be putting more military barracks to put in more soldiers, but that is well behind the sensitive area, he said in an interview to Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

“Those are the things you’re free to do and we are also free to do, because you’re doing it inside your territory and we are doing it inside our territory,” Bambawale said.

Indian troops intervened to stop their Chinese counterparts building a road close to India’s narrow corridor “Chicken Neck” area connecting northeastern states. Besides China, the area is also claimed by Bhutan.

Recent reports said that Chinese military was trying to work around or outflank the Indian troops at the Dokalam area.

Bambawale also reiterated his earlier comments that China should not change the status quo along the Indian border and inform India about its plans earlier.

“In the sense that if the Chinese military is going to build a road, then they must tell us ‘we are going to build a road’. If we do not agree to it then we can reply that, ‘look, you’re changing the status quo. Please don’t do it. This is a very very sensitive area,” the envoy said.

During the Dokalam standoff, China claimed that it had informed India about its plans. About lessons to be drawn, he called for delineation of the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) which China has refused.

“The India-China boundary is un-demarcated and un-delineated, so we have to talk to each other to delineate and demarcate it, which means to draw the boundary line. “Now for the last 30 years, not a single shot had been fired between the India-China border, which shows that we have been successful at maintaining peace and tranquillity.

Even during the Dokalam incident, a very serious incident, there was no firing, we were able to maintain peace and tranquillity. I think this is a successful example of diplomacy between our two countries,” Bambawale said.

He said both countries should move further to solve the problem. “We need to move further to actually solve the problem, which is to draw the boundary line. The boundary is quite long between India and China, roughly 3,500 km. In order to maintain the peace and tranquillity, there are certain areas, certain sectors which are very sensitive, where we must not change the status quo. If anyone changes the status quo, it will lead to a situation like what happened in Dokalam.

“The Chinese military changed the status quo in the Dokalam area and therefore India reacted to it. Ours was a reaction to the change in the status quo by the Chinese military,” he said, stressing that the two countries should have high-level communication on it.

“I agree entirely that it has to be brought down to practical levels. It shows that when incidents like Dokalam happened last year, it means that we were not frank enough and candid enough with each other. So we need to increase the level of frankness,” Bambawale said.

At present both countries are having “a lot of dialogue” at the political level and also at the economic level, the Indian envoy said as he welcomed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s recent comments that Indian elephant and Chinese dragon must not fight but dance together.

Referring to various visits planned between the two countries including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June to China to take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, he said that both the countries “especially on the political level, must be very frank and open and candid with each other”.

“There are some issues and problems between India and China, if we have to solve those problems, we need to talk candidly. That’s what I mean about the candid discussion. Only through talking frankly and candidly, we will be able to solve the issues and problems and understand each other’s concerns,” Bambawale said, asserting that the boundary issue is the most important problem between India and China.

“It is a leftover from history, but today’s governments are trying to tackle it. We are giving it a high priority. But only when both sides talk to each other very frankly and candidly, we will be able to resolve this boundary issue and decide on a boundary,” the envoy said. Both the sides should address each other’s concerns, he said.

“There are two principles that India has suggested to China. One is that each side must be sensitive to the other side’s aspirations, their concerns, their priorities and so on. The second is that we must not allow differences to become disputes. For example, we might have differences of opinion on Belt and Road, but that we must not allow that difference of opinion to become a dispute,” Bambawale added.

New Delhi: The spectre of farm distress has finally begun to haunt policymakers and the government is doing everything it can to address the situation, Rajiv Kumar, vice-chairman of central government think tank NITI Aayog, said on Friday.

“We in the NITI Aayog and the government have decided it is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers’ distress,” Kumar said, adding, “that’s a real issue which is beginning to haunt us... and (the issue is) so amazingly complex.”

“Thirty-eight per cent of our children are undernourished... and 60 million tonnes of foodgrains are being stocked somewhere while farmers are throwing away their produce (for want of a fair price)... I think it’s just a crying shame,” Kumar said at an event organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute in Delhi.

“Despite six decades of agricultural development, we still have a situation like this and it’s time to introspect deeply,” Kumar said.

“For the next few years, we have to concentrate on curbing hunger and malnutrition, and make sure that our farmers come up to the same level as their urban counterparts,” he added

Kumar’s comments come in the wake of repeated farmer protests, beginning in June last year, following a record harvest and a sharp fall in crop prices.

Farmers in several states are demanding fair prices and loan waivers, even as the central government has set an ambitious target to double farm incomes by 2022.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kumar said, has entrusted the NITI Aayog with ensuring that minimum support prices are effectively administered and the NITI Aayog is considering three distinct mechanisms. These include schemes on direct procurement by states at support prices, paying farmers the difference between ruling market price and MSP, and a private stockist scheme.

Kumar further said that it is “incumbent on us that we generate jobs outside agriculture and follow China’s path (to allow farmers to move out of agriculture)”.

Speaking at the event, director general of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, Trilochan Mohapatra, said that “farmers cry when they produce less (during a drought) and they also cry when they produce more (following a good harvest)... so when will they get more returns? By increasing MSP?”

Mohapatra added that at a recent fair organized by the agriculture ministry (Krishi Unnati Mela), a display of the electronic national agriculture market (eNAM) platform showed that all the products was selling below MSP. “This is what we accept and go happily with,” Mohapatra said.

Commenting on the price crash in agriculture, NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand said that “while the current situation is bad for farmers, it may not last long as price movements are often cyclical”. The government has responded to the situation by increasing import tariffs (in pulses and edible oils) and making changes in the MSP policy to help farmers, Chand added.",Farm distress is now haunting us: NITI Aayog’s Rajiv Kumar,"['aayog', 'agriculture', 'distress', 'farm', 'niti', 'farmers', 'kumar', 'prices', 'situation', 'haunting', 'aayogs', 'price', 'msp', 'produce', 'rajiv']","NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar’s comments come in the wake of repeated farmer protests, beginning in June last year, following a record harvest and a sharp fall in crop prices.

Photo: Hindustan Times

New Delhi: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on Saturday refuted reports about a fresh data leak of Aadhaar holders, and asserted that there has been “absolutely no breach” of its database.

The statement comes after ZDNet, a technology news portal cited a security researcher’s claim to state that a system of state-owned utility firm was allegedly leaking information on Aadhaar holders.

In a statement issued here, UIDAI, the Aadhaar-issuing body, said: “there is no truth in this story as there has been absolutely no breach of UIDAIs Aadhaar database. Aadhaar remains safe and secure”. It termed the data breach claims as “totally baseless, false and irresponsible”.

“UIDAI today has refuted reports in a certain section of media sourced from the news website ZDNet which has quoted a person purportedly claiming to be a security researcher that a state-owned utility company has vulnerability which can be used to access a huge amount of Aadhaar data including banking details,” UIDAI said in its statement.

The UIDAI has argued that even if the report claims were taken to be true, the security related concerns should be around the database of utility company in question. It has “nothing to do with security of UIDAIs Aadhaar database”, it said.

Going by the logic of the report, since the utility company’s database also had bank account numbers of its customers, would bank databases also be considered to have been breached, UIDAI questioned. “The answer would obviously be in negative,” it added.

UIDAI argued that mere availability of Aadhaar number with a third person “will not be a security threat to the Aadhaar holder” nor will it lead to financial or other fraud. This is because a transaction is contingent upon a successful authentication through fingerprint, Iris or OTP of the Aadhaar holder, UIDAI said.

The ZDNet report had claimed that “a data leak on a system run by a state-owned utility company can allow anyone to download private information on all Aadhaar holders, exposing their names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and information about services they are connected to, such as their bank details and other private information.”

The report of the alleged security lapse comes at a time when a Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar Act and the use of biometric identifier in various government and non-government services.

Earlier this week, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey had made a powerpoint presentation in the Supreme Court to defend the government’s ambitious Aadhaar scheme. He had said that breaking Aadhaar encryption may take “more than the age of the universe for the fastest computer on earth.”","UIDAI dismisses report of data leak, says Aadhaar remains safe","['data', 'zdnet', 'uidai', 'utility', 'dismisses', 'safe', 'leak', 'remains', 'information', 'database', 'report', 'aadhaar', 'stateowned', 'security']","Photo: Hindustan TimesNew Delhi: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on Saturday refuted reports about a fresh data leak of Aadhaar holders, and asserted that there has been “absolutely no breach” of its database.

Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Saturday said that the Rajya Sabha election result will have no impact on her party’s association with the Samajwadi Party and the two will work with even more force to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 general elections.

A day after her party candidate lost to the BJP in an intense contest in Uttar Pradesh despite backing from the SP, the BSP supremo said the ruling party, which secured the win through “undemocratic” and “unconstitutional” means, is expecting that she will break off ties with the SP and “it (BJP) will have a field day in 2019”, but she will not let it happen.

Accusing the BJP of indulging in malpractice in the election, she said that the ruling party had “conspired” to defeat her candidate to create a rift between the BSP and SP .

“I will not let that happen at any cost. They were up all night eating laddoos and thinking that Mayawati will get angry and break off and that they will have a field day in 2019...,” Mayawati told reporters here.

‘The Rajya Sabha election result will have no impact on the understanding between the BSP and SP and their conspiracy will cost them heavily as the workers of BSP and SP will now work with even more force to stop them from coming to power in 2019,” she said.

Her remarks came after Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav cancelled the victory celebration for his party nominee Jaya Bachchan to be held in the state capital today as a sign of solidarity with the BSP whose lone candidate backed by the SP lost in the Rajya Sabha polls.

‘There will not be an iota of difference in the close understanding between the BSP and SP ,” Mayawati said, making it clear that BSP is keen to consolidate its association with the SP which is seen as a major reason for the BJP’s recent defeat in two prestigious Lok Sabha seats of Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats.

After it wrested the two seats with the BSP’s backing, the SP had reciprocated by promising to ensure victory of BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar. However, the BSP lost out in a cliffhanger yesterday.

“I am thankful for the support of Congress and SP whose seven MLAs voted for BSP candidate,” Mayawati said. “I want to warn the BJP and RSS that I will not allow their special aim of creating rift in the new understanding between the BSP and Samajwadi Party to succeed,” she said.

The former UP chief minister, however, said that had she been in Akhilesh’s place she would have ensured the victory of the candidate of the other party even if it meant making sacrifices so that the BJP could not dare make attempt to end their closeness.

‘...He erred a little in this since he is a little inexperienced but he will soon learn to give a befitting reply,” she said and indicated that she was ready to put behind the bitter past with the SP.

The BJP leaders will remind her about the state guest house case in 1995, when an attempt was allegedly made on her life by SP men, Mayawati said and added that the present SP chief Akhilesh Yadav was nowhere on the political scene then. “Will it be right and justified to hold him responsible for it,” she said.

Attacking the BJP she said, ‘They still want to see dalits and backwards as deprived and are not able to digest the SP and BSP’s new understanding and have so termed it as selfish, unholy , opportunistic alliance or the friendship of snake and moles”, and asked the ruling party to shun such mindset or else the people will send them to “life long exile”.

On the guesthouse incident, she said, “I want to ask that by giving the highest police post to the officer responsible for the guest house case, is the BJP not out to get me murdered so as to end the BSP movement for always.”

Mayawati also said her party has always maintained that the SC/ST Act should not be misused, but accused the Centre of not taking up the matter effectively in the Supreme Court. She also announced the suspension of her MLA Anil Singh, alleging he cross voted in favour of the BJP to serve his business interests. She accused the BJP of creating terror and indulging in horse trading.

The BSP chief said that Rajya Sabha election results will not compensate for the loss suffered by the BJP in the Lok Sabha by-election in Gorakhpur and Phulpur.

To a question on MLA from Kunda, Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, she cautioned Akhilesh Yadav against relying on him. Mayawati said that if the BJP is so assured of its victory, it needs to conduct the future elections through ballot papers instead of EVMs.

Meanwhile, the Samajwadi Party said it had planned a function at the party headquarters here to celebrate the victory of its candidate Jaya Bachchan, but since the BSP candidate, Bhimrao Ambedkar (BSP) lost, party president Akhilesh Yadav has cancelled it.

After the BJP won nine out of 10 Rajya Sabha seats seats in the state, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had claimed that the election had exposed the “opportunistic face of SP”. “It can take votes but not give votes in return”, he said referring to SP’s victory in the recent Lok Sabha bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur.

Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma termed the alliance of the SP and the BSP as “lathabandhan” (a tie-up to intimidate people). “In fact, the alliance is not based on any principle except on ‘Modi hatao, BJP hatao’ (Remove Modi and BJP),” he said.","BSP-SP understanding to continue, will stop BJP from coming to power in 2019: Mayawati","['mayawati', 'chief', 'victory', 'continue', 'coming', 'party', 'understanding', '2019', 'sabha', 'stop', 'power', 'candidate', 'bspsp', 'sp', 'rajya', 'bjp', 'bsp']","BSP supremo Mayawati says there will not be an iota of difference in the close understanding between the BSP-SP because of the Rajya Sabha results yesterday.

New Delhi: India will soon have a national database of information on all narcotics-related crimes and criminals that can be accessed by enforcement agencies tasked with combating drugs menace, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday.

The minister, while delivering his valedictory address at the conclusion of the two-day ‘drug law enforcement’ conference here, said his ministry has sanctioned the required funds to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).

“Narcotics Control Bureau has been provided funds for developing a new software -- seizure information management system (SIMS) -- which will create a complete online database of drug offences and offenders.

“All enforcement agencies including state police departments, up to the district level, will have access to the database,” Singh said.

The minister said that taking note of the emerging drug abuse pattern in the country, the government last year scheduled seven new substances into the list of narcotic drugs so that “action can be taken against trafficking in these substances”.

The NCB is the national agency for undertaking anti-narcotics measures and enforcement action and it coordinates with multiple police and government agencies to render this task.","India to have new database on narco crimes, criminals: Rajnath Singh","['singh', 'agencies', 'rajnath', 'criminals', 'drug', 'india', 'national', 'union', 'information', 'database', 'minister', 'enforcement', 'crimes', 'narco']","A file photo of Union home minister Rajnath Singh.

Beijing: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit China to take part in the SCO summit in June during which there will “definitely” be a bilateral meeting between him and President Xi Jinping, India’s envoy Gautam Bambawale has said.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a China-dominated security grouping, is increasingly seen as a counterweight to NATO. The SCO summit is due to be held in the Chinese city of Qingdao from 9-10 June.

In an interview to Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, Bambawale said: “During that (SCO summit), we will definitely have a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping. And before that happens we want to have a lot of other meetings”.

“We will have a whole series of meetings in the next few weeks and months,” the envoy said, adding that the boundary officials of both the countries will also be meeting. “We are having these meetings to have candid and frank discussions,” Bambawale said.

Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said that she would visit China next month. The foreign ministers of the SCO countries are also due to meet before the summit.

Last year, Indian and Chinese troops had been locked in a stand off for over two months at the Dokalam area in Sikkim section. The face off ended on 28 August.

New Delhi: A day after securing bail from the Delhi high court in INX Media case, Karti Chidambaram on Saturday got another relief from a Delhi court which granted him protection from arrest till 16 April in Aircel-Maxis matter arising out of the 2G spectrum cases lodged by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Special Judge O.P. Saini granted the relief to him considering that both the investigative agencies sought three weeks to file their responses on the anticipatory bail plea moved by Karti, son of former union minister P. Chidambaram.

The court, which pronounced the order in a packed courtroom, also said that Karti shall not leave the country without its permission and will appear before the investigating officer as and when directed to join the investigation.

“Since three weeks’ time is prayed for by the CBI, by submitting that during this period law shall prevail, apparently it means that as a matter of legal and judicial propriety, the applicant (Karti) shall not be arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) during the pendency of the instant application. This is in consonance with the provisions of section 41A of the CrPC.

“Accordingly, it is directed that in case presence of the applicant is required by the IO during three weeks’ time prayed for by the senior PP for the CBI, he shall appear before the IO as and when directed and shall join the investigation,” the judge said.

An identical order was passed in the ED case too. “Put up the application for reply by the CBI/ED and disposal on 16 April as prayed. Till then, the applicant shall not be arrested in the instant case,” the judge said in the orders.

Arguing in the CBI case earlier in the day, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, appearing for Karti, said that there was neither any allegation against Karti in the Aircel Maxis case nor there was anything to show that he knew the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) officials.

He argued that Karti’s name has not figured in any FIR (first information report) in the case and he was only called by the CBI as a witness in 2014. “I am entitled to protection till the time they (CBI) demonstrate anything against me in the court,” Sibal said.

Opposing his contention, CBI public prosecutor K.K. Goel said the application of Karti was defective and not maintainable for interim relief.

In the ED case, senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam, also appearing for Karti, argued that Karti has cooperated in the other matters as well and there was no question that he would flee the county or tamper with evidence.

ED counsel Nitesh Rana too opposed the anticipatory bail plea and said Karti’s counsel have failed to demonstrate on what basis he apprehends his immediate arrest in the case. “The application is wholly without merit,” he said while seeking three weeks time to reply to the plea.

Former finance minister P.Chidambaram, also a senior advocate himself, was present in the court room along with his wife Nalini Chidambaram seeking relief for his son. Both were in advocate’s attire. While senior Chidambaram wore black coat and trousers, Nalini was seen wearing an advocate’s black robe. Besides them, a battery of senior lawyers appeared in the court for Karti, including Sibal, Subramanium, Salman Khurshid, also a Congress leader, and Mohit Mathur to secure anticipatory bail for him.

During the hearing, Sibal also referred to the 2 February 2017 verdict of the court which had discharged former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother Kalanithi in the Aircel Maxis case and said after this order, no FIR was lodged by the agencies.

Hours after being granted bail by the Delhi high court in the INX media case, Karti had yesterday filed a plea seeking protection from arrest in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have lodged cases in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

The matter pertains to grant of FIPB clearance to firm M/S Global Communication Holding Services Ltd for investment in Aircel.

In September 2015 the CBI had filed its status report regarding probe into FIPB approvals in Aircel Maxis case.

Geneva: The World Trade Organization chief warned states Friday that creating barriers to international trade would “jeopardise the global economy,” after Washington slapped steep tariffs on Chinese imports, heightening fears of a trade war.

“Disrupting trade flows will jeopardise the global economy at a time when economic recovery, though fragile, has been increasingly evident around the world,” WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement, calling for “restraint and urgent dialogue”.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday hit China with tariffs on up to $60 billion (€48.5 billion) of imports to retaliate against the “theft” of American intellectual property, fuelling fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Washington also launched Friday a challenge before the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) against China over intellectual property breaches.

China meanwhile warned the United States that it was “not afraid of a trade war” as it threatened tariffs on $3 billion worth of US goods in retaliation over the US measures.

In his statement, Azevedo said that during a meeting of WTO’s Council of Trade in Goods, member states had discussed “a number of the specific tensions that have arisen between different members in recent weeks.”

“I encourage members to continue working through the WTO’s many forums and mechanisms to deal with their concerns and explore potential solutions,” he said, without naming any specific countries.

“Actions taken outside these collective processes greatly increase the risk of escalation in a confrontation that will have no winners, and which could quickly lead to a less stable trading system,” he warned.

“I again call for restraint and urgent dialogue as the best path forward to resolve these problems.”

New Delhi: The commerce ministry’s investigation arm Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) said it is terminating its anti-dumping probe on imports of solar cells from China, Taiwan and Malaysia. The Indian Solar Manufacturers Association has made a request to terminate the present investigation, it added.

The probe was initiated by the DGAD on 21 July last year following complaints of dumping of the product by the association. “The authority is constrained to terminate the present antidumping investigation concerning imports of ‘solar cells whether or not assembled partially or fully in modules or Panels or on glass or some other suitable substrates’,” from these countries, DGAD said in a notification.

The domestic industry has cited certain reasons for its request to terminate the probe. They have stated that post-initiation, the injury being suffered by the domestic producers on account of dumping has aggravated sharply. Besides, the industry has said that the imports of the cells from these countries have increased substantially in the recent period.

The period of investigation covers April 2016 to June 2017 (15 months). The directorate, however, noted that “the reason cited by the domestic industry for termination of the petition is devoid of any merit”. But it said Rule 14(a) of the anti-dumping rules does not grant any discretion to the DGAD in the matter of termination of investigation, once the domestic industry files a written request for termination of the probe.

Anti-dumping duties are levied to provide a level playing field to local industry by guarding against cheap below-cost imports. Increasing imports and dumping of goods from China have always been an area of concern for Indian companies. India’s exports to China were only $10.2 billion in 2016-17 but imports aggregated to $61.3 billion.

DGAD is also probing dumping of several other products such as certain chemicals and steel products from China and other countries. India is one of the most attractive markets for global producers due to its large middle class population.

Imposition of anti-dumping duty is permissible under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime. Both India and China are members of the Geneva-based body. The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.",Commerce ministry terminates anti-dumping probe on solar cells,"['probe', 'industry', 'imports', 'investigation', 'terminate', 'terminates', 'cells', 'producers', 'domestic', 'china', 'antidumping', 'ministry', 'commerce', 'dumping', 'request', 'solar']","The domestic industry has cited certain reasons for its request to terminate the probe.

New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday hit out at law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad over huge pendency of cases in the courts and shortage of judges and charged him with “peddling fake news” instead.

His attack came after Prasad accused the Congress of hiring the services of controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica, accused of harvesting data stolen from Facebook, in previous elections. The charge has been denied by the Congress, which instead accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using the services of the firm.

“Legal system collapsing under Pending Cases: Supreme Court 55,000+, High Court 37 Lakh+, Lower Courts 2.6 Crore+. Yet, a staggering 400 High Court and 6,000 Lower Court judges not appointed, while Law Minister preoccupied peddling fake news,” Gandhi said on Twitter, using the hashtag “JudiciaryDemonetised”.

The Congress and the BJP have been engaged in a slinging match between each other accusing the other of using the services of the controversial data firm. The Facebook data scandal erupted after a whistleblower revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to Trump’s 2016 campaign, accessed personal data from 50 million users of the website without their knowledge, and might have kept that data even after the social media giant told the company to delete it.

Johannesburg/Lima: South Africa escaped a third junk rating as Moody’s Investors Service kept its assessment of the nation’s debt unchanged, citing more transparent and predictable policies under President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The African nation’s outlook was revised to stable from negative. The decision will boost sentiment and probably bolster the rand, which rallied after Ramaphosa took over as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December and became president last month. With the local-currency rating remaining investment grade, the nation avoids being excluded from global benchmark indexes that could have led to outflows of as much as much as 100 billion rand ($8.4 billion).

Moody’s maintained the nation’s local- and foreign-currency assessments at Baa3, the lowest investment-grade level, the ratings company said in a statement on Friday. The affirmation keeps South Africa on the same level as that of Indonesia and Romania.

“The recent change in political leadership appears to have halted the gradual erosion of the strength of South Africa’s institutions,” Moody’s analysts Zuzana Brixiova and Marie Diron wrote in the statement.

Weak growth

While economic growth in Africa’s most-industrialized economy exceeded the government’s forecast last year, it’s been below 2% since 2014. Finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who was reappointed last month, said the National Treasury may raise its projected 1.5% growth forecast for 2018.

“Our economy shouldn’t be performing at this level, we should be performing much higher than 1.5 percent,” Dondo Mogajane, director-general of National Treasury said in an interview. “If you add on the other things that we’ve spoken about, the confidence, telecoms, the barriers to entry issues, transport and focus on agriculture and investment in tourism, clearly all of those combined should give you a decent number that you can add on to the base of 1.5 percent.”

The National Treasury also said it’s working to provide policy certainty on issues such as mining legislation.

The nation’s banking association says stronger fiscal discipline and good governance is required to eliminate wasteful and unauthorized expenditure and to place state-owned enterprises on a sustainable footing, in order to regain its investment rating from all three major credit rating companies.

“This places us in purgatory, so we aren’t going to heaven and we aren’t going to hell either,” Thabi Leoka, an independent economist in Johannesburg, said by phone before the announcement. “We still have very low growth over the next two years and we still have a revenue shortfall, while already surpassing the spending ceiling and we need to fix all of those, quite significantly, before we we can actually be in a comfortable position regarding our rating.”

Fitch Ratings Ltd affirmed the country’s debt scores at its highest non-investment grade in November with a stable outlook while S&P Global Ratings lowered the nation’s rand debt to junk and cut the foreign-currency assessment to two levels below investment grade. S&P is scheduled to make a ratings announcement on 25 May.

The rand led gains among the world’s major peers in the week ended Friday, climbing almost 2% against the US dollar on speculation South Africa would avert a downgrade. The currency has risen more than 5% this year.

New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Saturday said Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N. Chandrababu Naidu’s decision to quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was guided by “political considerations” instead of Andhra Pradesh’s development concerns, and dubbed his move “unfortunate and unilateral”.

In a letter to the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, who broke ties with the BJP after the Centre declined to grant Special Category Status to AP, Shah also said his party is a true well wisher of the state. He also cited a number of development projects undertaken by the Centre for the state, besides funds given to it, as he sought to reject the charge that the Modi government had not fulfilled its promises.

“This decision is both unfortunate as well as unilateral.

“You may recall that during the previous Lok Sabha and in Rajya Sabha, when your party did not have adequate representation, it was the BJP that set the agenda and ensured that justice is done to the hardworking Telugu people in both states.”

Listing five infrastructure projects the Central government has initiated in the state, Shah said “a perusal of these would reaffirm what you already know and perhaps would not admit that Central government has fulfilled its obligations and that BJP is a genuine friend add true well wisher of the state.”

The TDP pulled out of the BJP-led alliance over the refusal to accord special category status to Andhra Pradesh and fulfil other commitments made at the time of state’s division in 2014. The TDP has also given notice for a no-confidence motion against the Modi government in the Lok Sabha, which could not be taken up due to an unending uproar in the Lower House.

“On the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh, it is regrettable that some political parties are whipping up public sentiments rather than encouraging an informed debate which is the cornerstone of a vibrant democracy. “I would like you to introspect whether political parties should be pitting sentiments and development against each other to further their political agenda,” Shah told Naidu.","Amit Shah writes to Naidu, says TDP left NDA govt for ‘political consideration’","['consideration', 'govt', 'political', 'amit', 'party', 'left', 'development', 'true', 'nda', 'wisher', 'shah', 'naidu', 'pradesh', 'andhra', 'tdp', 'writes', 'bjp']","In his letter, BJP chief Amit Shah also said his party is a true well wisher of Andhra Pradesh.

Beijing: Chinese officials and state media said the country will defend itself in a trade war, warning that President Donald Trump’s tariff plans could backfire on the United States.

Vice premier Liu He told US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call that Washington’s investigation into alleged Chinese infringement of US intellectual property violates international rules and will harm the interests of both countries, the official Xinhua News reported on Saturday.

“China is prepared and has the ability to defend its national interests,” Liu was cited as saying. Liu, top economic counselor to President Xi Jinping, urged both countries to work together and ensure the overall stability of China-US trade and economic ties, according to Xinhua.

Trump on Friday outlined fresh tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports and directed Mnuchin to propose new investment restrictions on Chinese companies within 60 days to safeguard strategic technologies. China unveiled tariffs on $3 billion of US imports in response to steel and aluminium duties ordered by Trump earlier this month and indicated it is considering further steps, including possibly scaling back purchases of Treasuries.

American corporate giants such as Apple Inc., Boeing Co. and Intel Corp. rake in huge revenues from China each year and will see their global interests damaged in a trade war, according to a commentary carried on the front page of the Saturday overseas edition of the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party.

Lou Jiwei, chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund, said so far China’s response to the Trump administration’s tariffs has not hit the US “where it hurts.”

“If I were still in the government, I would be hitting soybeans, automobiles, and airplanes,” the former finance minister said at the China Development Forum on Saturday.

Ranchi: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad was on Saturday sentenced to 14 years in jail and fined Rs60 lakh by a special CBI court in the fourth fodder scam case pertaining to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs3.13 crore from the Dumka treasury in the early 1990s, a CBI counsel said in Ranchi.

CBI judge Shiv Pal Singh awarded two sentences of seven years each to the former Bihar chief minister under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Acts, he said. Prabhat Kumar, Lalu Prasad’s counsel, told journalists that he will appeal in a higher court against the judgment.

The court had on 19 March held the 69-year-old RJD chief guilty along with 18 others in connection with the case—RC 38 A/96. Former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra, however, was acquitted in the case along with 12 other accused.

Photo: Reuters

Washington: President Donald Trump has banned transgender people from the US military in most circumstances, the latest in a series of actions that may resonate with his most ardent supporters as crucial midterm elections approach.

Trump’s statement was immediately denounced by civil-liberties groups and Democratic leaders, and capped a week in which he touched off a confrontation with China by following through with his campaign pledge to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, and ousted his national security adviser, who had been seen as a moderating influence, in favour of John Bolton, a hero of the right.

Trump said in the statement late Friday that “transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria—individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery—are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.”

The ban, which the president first proposed last summer, touched off a legal confrontation and reignited a cultural debate that had already seen fierce disagreements and campaigns in some states to require that students use school restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.

Citing threats to troop readiness and morale, as well as costs associated with medical services, Trump said in a series of tweets in July that he would reverse President Barack Obama’s policy allowing transgender people to join the armed forces.

“After consultation with my generals and military experts, please be advised that the U.S. government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military,” the president said then, though the announcement seemed to catch the Pentagon off guard.

Mattis memorandum

In a Department of Defense memorandum to the president dated that was dated 22 February, defence secretary James Mattis said that after studying the question, the Pentagon “concludes that there are substantial risks associated with allowing the accession and retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and require, or have already undertaken, a course of treatment to change their gender.”

Mattis recommended, however, that service members “who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the previous administration policy took effect and prior to the effective date of this new policy, may continue to serve in their preferred gender.” He also said that exceptions could be granted for people “who have been stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex prior to accession;” or had been “diagnosed with gender dysphoria” after they entered the military but did not require a change for gender.

Opponents, some of whom had been fighting the administration in court, quickly responded to Trump’s latest statement.

“The policy effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country,” Joshua Block, a senior staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project, said in a statement.

Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, a California-based institute that researches the military service of sexual minorities, said there was “no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy.”

Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat and the House minority leader, called the ban “cowardly, disgusting.”

“No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are,” Pelosi said in a statement.

In the 2016 campaign, Trump actively sought the support of socially conservative groups, some of whom supported the bathroom access restrictions, while also promising to “fight for” the gay and transgender community.

Gregory T. Angelo—president of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that advocates for equal rights for the LGBT community—said in a statement that the policy appeared to allow “continued open service of current transgender soldiers,” tantamount to an admission by the Pentagon that “there is ultimately no difficulty with the status quo” and that the policy is reverse engineered and may succeed only in “stoking culture wars.”

More challenges planned

Civil rights advocates said while some transgender service members might be permitted to continue to serve under the announced policy, the exceptions seemed unclear and the policy was likely to foster a hostile climate for those who seek to continue to serve. They said they would continue to fight the policy in the courts.

At least four lawsuits have been filed seeking to overturn the ban, and several courts issued preliminary injunctions while the cases proceed. In November, US district judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore, called the president’s tweets announcing the change in policy “capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified.”

And last week, a federal judge in Washington said that the Trump administration had failed to identify evidence it might use to defend the policy.

That judge, Marsha Pechman, criticized the administration’s earlier claims that no such information could be identified because the policy was not in effect.

United Nations: India is among 20 nations that have pledged a total of about $100 million to the UN relief agency charged with the well-being of Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced gratitude for the generous pledges of approximately $100 million made at the extraordinary ministerial conference in Rome on 15 March titled ‘Preserving Dignity and Sharing Responsibility — Mobilizing Collective Action for UNRWA’.

Almost 20 donors pledged additional contributions, including Qatar, Norway, Turkey, Canada, India and Switzerland. Giving details of the pledges made by the nations, Guterres’s spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York on Friday that the Emir of the Qatar pledged $50 million in new contributions, while Norway pledged $13.6 million, Turkey $10 million and a doubling of their food aid, Canada $7.7 million, India $5 million and Switzerland $4.2 million.

He said the ministerial conference was an “exceptional demonstration” of high-level support for UNRWA’s mandate and a recognition for the continued necessity of its work in support of over five million Palestine refugees. Dujarric added that the pledges made in Rome represent an important first step, yet a lot of work remains to fully close the critical shortfall.

“The Secretary-General encourages all Member States and the private sector to provide support to UNRWA in order to close the still critical funding shortfall. He reiterates that the services provided by UNRWA to Palestine refugees are essential and contribute to bring stability to the region,” the spokesman said.

Seoul: North Korea has agreed to hold high-level talks with South Korea on 29 March at the border truce village of Panmunjom to prepare for a summit of their leaders planned for April, the South said on Saturday.

A team of three officials will be led by Ri Son Gwon, the chairman of North Korea’s committee for the peaceful reunification of the country, the North told its neighbour early on Saturday, the South’s unification ministry said.

“This morning, North Korea sent a message through a communication channel in Panmunjom agreeing to our suggestion made on the 22nd to hold high-level inter-Korea talks,” the ministry said in a statement.

The stakes are higher for a potential summit between US President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart that may take place by the end of May, however.

Trump this week named John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations famed for his hawkish views on Pyongyang, to replace White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Trump fired secretary of state Rex Tillerson on 13 March, saying the two had disagreed over Iran and other foreign policy matters.

New Delhi: The Union government on Thursday signalled a zero-tolerance approach to white-collar crime, approving a new law targeting economic offenders fleeing the country, and creating a regulator for chartered accountants and audit firms.

The actions, coming two weeks after Punjab National Bank (PNB) went public with a multi-billion dollar fraud, are part of a series of steps the government has initiated to mitigate the financial and political fallout of the scam.

These include banking and bankruptcy reforms, disqualification of directors of errant companies, striking shell companies off the records and stringent action taken by various regulators in the last few weeks against those who allegedly duped banks. Thursday’s cabinet decisions are expected to create a deterrent to economic offenders fleeing the country and make auditors more accountable for their actions.

The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018, which will be tabled when the budget session of Parliament resumes, provides for proclaiming an economic offender who has fled the country as a fugitive, issuing an arrest warrant against the person and confiscating his or her assets before conviction.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who briefed reporters about the decision, said that the bill provides for confiscating all assets of such offenders including any benami assets (held by proxies), not just the proceeds of crime. “In future, there will be a mechanism for international cooperation too. We will need an appropriate arrangement with other nations to confiscate overseas assets of such offenders,” Jaitley said.

Only offences above Rs100 crore will be pursued under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018 in order to prevent overcrowding of courts.

At the same time, the government has decided to set up a National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to regulate auditors. Creating such a body was first proposed in the Companies Act, 2013.

Once it is created, NFRA can impose a penalty of up to five times the fee received in the case of professional or other misconduct by individual chartered accountants and up to 10 times the fees received in the case of audit firms. It can also bar an auditor up to 10 years. NFRA will probe professional misconduct of auditors in all listed companies and in large unlisted companies, the size of which will be specified in the rules, an official statement said.

Over the past few weeks, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the income-tax department, among others, have frozen bank accounts and seized properties of jewellery designer Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. Companies linked to Modi and Choksi are allegedly involved in the PNB fraud, the size of which has been now revised to Rs12,636 crore. Separately, investigative agencies have seized assets of Rotomac group, which has defaulted on Rs3,695 crore worth of loans.

On Thursday, ED attached 41 properties worth Rs1,217 crore belonging to Choksi and his Gitanjali group.

Modi, Choksi and liquor magnate Vijay Mallya, all of whom are wanted by one investigative agency or the other, have fled the country. Mallya’s spokesperson and Choksi’s lawyer declined to comment for the story. Calls and messages to the lawyer representing Nirav Modi remained unanswered till press time.

“Clearly, the current regulations have not been successful to get auditors to work independently. This body (NFRA) and the rules framed should achieve this objective. This should reinstate confidence in audits and financial statements of companies and financial institutions,” said Daksha Baxi, executive director of law firm Khaitan & Co.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, CBI arrested former PNB chief manager Bishnubrata Mishra. He was responsible for concurrent audit at the bank during 2011-2015.

Mumbai: Even as harsh legislation to punish fugitive economic offenders takes shape in India, 31 individuals accused of fraud and economic offences are holed up abroad, the ministry of external affairs said.

These people, pursued by the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 15 different cases, collectively owe Rs40,000 crore to banks and public institutions in India, calculations by Mint based on investigation reports show.

The list of fugitives that the ministry of external affairs submitted in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday includes some well-known names and some not-so-well-known ones.

Among the prominent names are Vijay Mallya, who owes Rs9,000 crore to a group of banks; Nirav Modi, his wife Ami Modi, brother Neeshal Modi and uncle Mehul Choksi, named in the Rs12,636 crore fraud at Punjab National Bank; Jatin Mehta of Winsome Diamonds, who owes Rs7,000 crore; former Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi, accused of siphoning off Rs125 crore from the country’s cricket board; and Sterling Biotech Ltd directors Chetan Jayantilal Sandesara and Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara for alleged bank fraud of Rs5,000 crore.

The lesser-known names include Ashish Jobanputra, promoter of Mumbai-based textile export firm ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd, and his wife in a bill discounting scam of Rs770 crore and for causing losses to banks; diamond trader Ritesh Jain for illegally taking Rs1,500 crore out of the country; Surender Singh, Angad Singh and Harsahib Singh for cheating and criminal conspiracy; Sabhya Seth for a fraud of Rs390 crore against Oriental Bank of Commerce; and Sanjay Bhandari for alleged tax evasion of Rs150 crore.

Nilesh Parekh of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, accused of a Rs2,223 crore bank fraud, was arrested by CBI last year after he returned to India to join the probe. There is little to no public information about the rest of the names.

Experts say legislation to target fugitive economic offenders will act as a deterrent and could also be used retrospectively in some cases.

“The legislation is not stated to be retrospective in effect. However, directors of enforcement agencies can make an application to declare any person as ‘fugitive economic offender’ if the said person either leaves or has left India in order to avoid criminal prosecution and/or refuses to return to India to face criminal prosecution. Therefore, for offences which have been committed even before the coming into effect of the bill as an Act, it will help,” said Sandeep Grover, partner at law firm IndusLaw.

How the Congress engages with the SP-BSP alliance could also have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) defeat in the recent UP Lok Sabha bypolls has been mainly attributed to the successful alliance between two erstwhile arch-rivals: the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The brute arithmetic in favour of the alliance proved to be unassailable for the BJP even in Gorakhpur, a seat held by the party since 1991, vacated recently by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The smooth sailing of the SP-BSP alliance in the UP bypolls and evident bonhomie among the leaders of the two parties after tasting victory have raised expectations of a similar front being put up against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Evidence from post-poll surveys conducted by the Lokniti research programme at the New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) suggests that the narrowing social base of both parties since 2014 has made it politically pragmatic for them to bury differences and come together. Our analysis also suggests that the combined electoral strength of the two parties will pose a formidable challenge for the BJP in the country’s largest state, which sends 80 Lok Sabha members to the 543-strong Lower House.

The decision of the SP and BSP to explore the possibility of an electoral alliance seems to be driven by the threat that the BJP poses to their respective electoral bases. As the chart illustrates, the BJP has been very effective in mobilizing social groups which were reluctant to vote for it prior to 2014. The party has managed to wean away non-Yadav OBC (other backward classes) voters from the SP and non-Jatav Dalit voters from the BSP.

The BJP’s ability to mobilize support among these social groups during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 UP elections sent alarm bells ringing in the state as it restricted the support base of the SP to Muslims and Yadavs, and that of the BSP to Jatav voters. The challenge is more acute for the BSP which has lost a section of its core support base—non-Jatav Dalits—to the BJP. It may be difficult for the BSP to arrest the decline in its support base unless the BJP’s juggernaut in Uttar Pradesh is halted.

At the moment, it seems that a grand alliance is the only effective strategy to consolidate anti-BJP votes, and to potentially damage the BJP’s prospects in the state. At the aggregate level, in both 2014 and 2017, the combined vote share of SP and BSP exceeded that of the BJP and its allies.

This is also true at the constituency-level, when we compare the seat-wise BJP vote share with the combined vote share of BSP and SP. Of the 73 Lok Sabha constituencies that the BJP and Apna Dal won in 2014, the vote share of the BJP alliance was higher than the combined vote-share of the SP-BSP in only about half of them (39 seats). More importantly, only in 22 of the 73 seats did the BJP have a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the SP-BSP alliance.

In the 2017 UP elections, the BJP alliance’s vote share was greater than the combined vote share of the Congress, SP and BSP in 116 of the 325 assembly constituencies won by the BJP and its partners.

The SP and BSP may have successfully tested waters in Gorakhpur and Phulpur but it remains to be seen if they actually decide to extend this cooperation to 2019 Lok Sabha elections. If they do so, the road ahead would not be entirely bereft of challenges. The top leadership will have to convince the local leadership and keep party workers enthused to campaign for their respective alliance partners. Negotiations on seat sharing are unlikely to be smooth. Also, anti-BJPism cannot be the only glue that holds the alliance together. Unless there is a broader synergy between the parties and their workers, the alliance may unravel. How the Congress engages with the SP-BSP alliance could also have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

All eyes will be on these dynamics over the next few months as Uttar Pradesh is known to determine national fortunes.

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday granted bail to Karti Chidambaram, son of former Union minister P. Chidambaram, in connection with the INX Media case, on submission of a Rs10 lakh personal bond.

Justice S.P. Garg directed Karti to be available to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for joining the investigation as and when required, and not leave the country without prior permission of the CBI court.

The court also told him not to close any bank account in India or abroad, or change the entity or composition of any business concerns he is associated with, without prior intimation to CBI.

In his 27-page judgement, Justice Garg observed: “...generally bail should not be refused unless the crime charged is of the highest magnitude and the punishment of it assigned by law is of extreme severity. There appears no possibility of the petitioner (Karti Chidambaram) to flee from justice. His parents are senior advocates; he has a family to take care of; he has roots in the society and is not a previous convict.”

Mumbai: Politics in India has increasingly revolved around the demand for special status and more funds by a few states. However, obtaining and spending more funds does not guarantee better outcomes for a state unless those are spent in an efficient manner. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) for states’ spending reveals that many states are operating much below the “efficient frontier”, according to Ranjan Kumar Mohanty and N.R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), a research institute under the finance ministry. DEA is often used to compare the efficiency of factories or plants. Applied to Indian states, it reveals that western states such as Maharashtra, Goa, and Gujarat are relatively more efficient in spending their money on social sector, based on data from 2002-03, 2008-09 and 2015-16. The results also suggest that states are spending their resources more efficiently on education than on health and overall social sector.

Aging population leads to greater industrial automation and usage of robots, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Daron Acemoglu, professor of economics at MIT, and Pascual Restrepo, assistant professor at Boston University. They find that Germany and Japan, characterized by ageing population, have been the more enthusiastic adopters of automation. Thus an aging workforce does not necessarily mean falling productivity, especially when one accounts for the likely technological response to aging. Studying trends within US, the authors find that robots have been primarily deployed to replace middle-aged workers, i.e. those between the ages of 36 and 55. Hence, uptake of industrial automation is most likely in sectors and places where middle-aged and older workers are more predominant.

Being born into a rich family in USA increases your chances of ending up rich, unless of course you are Black, according to a new study by Raj Chetty, professor at Stanford University, and others. A Black American man hailing from a family in the top one-fifth income bracket is more likely to end up in the bottom one-fifth bracket – with a 21% chance – than remain in the top bracket, with a 17% chance. On the other hand, a white man born to a rich family has a 40% chance of remaining there. These conclusions are based on data from census and tax returns, used to study the journey of children born between 1978 and 1983. The disparity between Black and White adults hailing from similar family backgrounds is more pronounced in case of men than women, suggesting that Black men are often the worst victims of racism. Negative stereotypes about Black men, accompanied by higher chances of them facing police action or being incarcerated, might be impeding their career progress.

The implementation of a congestion tax in central Stockholm resulted in a decrease in both pollution as well as asthma attacks in children, found a study published in the NBER by Emilia Simeonova, assistant professor at the John Hopkins Carey School of Business, and others. The government levied a charge on most vehicles entering the city centre of Stockholm, Sweden’s capital, from August 2007 onwards. This move reduced pollution from automobiles by 5 to 15%. This was accompanied by significant reductions in the incidence of childhood asthma in Stockholm in the months and years after the program. Given that improvements in health occurred even when pollution was already below US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, the authors suggest that health gains could be more significant in areas with higher pollution levels.

Global risk conditions no longer seem to affect cross-border lending by banks ever since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, according to research by Stefan Avdjiev, senior economist at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and others. This is because post-crisis, the share of euro-area banks in international lending market declined while it increased for banks from other advanced economies with relatively stronger, i.e. better capitalized, banking systems. These banks were better able to withstand fluctuations in global risk conditions, as their dependence on market for funding was relatively lesser. Instead, they relied more on traditional sources of funding such as deposits. Of course, support from the respective central banks, in the form of low interest rates and “quantitative easing” may have also aided the banks in maintaining steady flows.

New Delhi: More Indian homes have access to a phone than a water tap or toilet within the house. While at least the physical presence of toilets has increased due to the Swachh Bharat Mission, public attention on the need to expand access to safe water has dropped off the radar.

In an interview on the eve of World Water Day on 22March, Parameswaran Iyer, secretary in the ministry of drinking water and sanitation, talks about the government’s plan to provide piped water to every Indian household, the programme’s sustainability, and linkages between water access and Swachh Bharat. Edited excerpts:

According to census figures, more households in India have access to a phone than a water tap within their homes. Government schemes at least since 1969 have tried to improve the coverage. Why has this been such a hard problem to solve?

I think a fair amount of progress has been made. Nearly 80% of India’s rural dwellers receive the prescribed 40 litres of water per person per day through some source—a dug well, a nearby river, a handpump, etc. If you look at only piped water supply, which includes both private connections as well as public stand posts, about 56% of India’s rural households have access. When it comes to individual households with a water tap inside the house, that ratio is about 17-18%. There are these three different ways of looking at access to water. In the end, people would prefer to have piped water supply in their households. That is the aspiration. And we are developing a road map to achieve that over a period of time. There are a variety of reasons as to why drinking water supply, particularly in rural areas, is challenging. Drinking water is different from any other form of infrastructure. We need to worry about where we source the water since groundwater levels have been depleting fast; we need to think of ways to incorporate operational and maintenance expenses, which are significant; and we need to decentralize water management to the lowest appropriate level. There are also issues related to the charging of user fees.

You mentioned coverage. In rural areas, it stands at about 17%. The government’s goal is to push that up to 90% by 2022. Is this achievable?

We have taken a first step towards that goal by restructuring the national rural drinking water programme and turning it into a performance and results-based scheme. In a major reform, the government decided in November 2017 that only the first instalment of central funds will be released to states through the current method of using a formula, which includes criteria like degree of scarcity, population, the geography of the terrain, etc. Further release of funds will now be based on an evaluation of performance and sustainability, which will be undertaken by an independent third party. It is a very good step to link funding with performance and results. This will incentivize states which deliver results.

But it looks like the country will miss the 35% coverage target set for March 2018 in its march towards the 2022 goal...

We are taking a look at these targets again. We want to make sure the process we have initiated is followed—on how the water is supplied. It’s not just about reaching a target, which may then not be sustained. So, it needs to be done in a sustainable way. And that’s what we are working towards with the state governments. India is a large country. States are at different levels of coverage of piped water supply. Every state has different issues, so a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work.

Several parliamentary standing committees have also pointed to the worrying trend of slip-backs, where habitations which do get water lose that status in a few years. One report said that nearly 140,000 habitations slip back each year.

One of the major focus areas, going forward, is how do you ensure sustainability of the water source and prevent it from getting depleted. What we are going to try and do going forward is to make sure there is integration with water conservation measures undertaken under MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act). So, when we increase water supply, particularly in rural areas, we need to make sure measures to preserve source sustainability are taken, in terms of water conservation and watershed development activity. That is one way to make sure whatever extraction takes place is sustainable as a result of adequate recharge.

Will user charges also be used as a mechanism to limit water usage?

I think efforts are under way in that direction across all ministries. There is an economic as well as social cost to water. It’s important to have an appropriate pricing mechanism. It has to be balanced with affordability as well. But there is increasing emphasis on the fact that there is a cost to water. Ultimately, it will be the states and local bodies which deliver the service that will take a call on pricing.

The government has been claiming significant improvements in toilet coverage due to Swachh Bharat. How usable will these new toilets be without easy and adequate access to water?

Clearly, there is a connection between water access and sanitation. We are addressing that in a couple of ways. Any village which has become open defecation free (ODF) will get priority for water supply through piped water. That’s a policy decision which has been taken. So, there is now an incentive for villages to become ODF. At a technical level, the emphasis is on kam paani wala toilets which have a steeper slope, and hence use very little water to flush. The typical toilet pan takes anywhere between four-five litres per flush. We are introducing a technology where the water consumption is about 1.5 litres per flush. So, these new toilets will need less water. But obviously, the more villages get piped water, the easier it will become to use these new toilets.",Funds to states will be based on performance: Parameswaran Iyer,"['supply', 'coverage', 'need', 'sustainability', 'performance', 'funds', 'drinking', 'parameswaran', 'iyer', 'water', 'based', 'rural', 'piped', 'access', 'states', 'toilets']","Parameswaran Iyer, secretary in the ministry of drinking water and sanitation and an erstwhile World Bank expert on water-related issues.

New Delhi: A parliamentary panel has recommended including modules on Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) treatments in MBBS courses and vice versa, in a bid to reconcile allopathic and alternative systems of medicines and generate faith in AYUSH treatments.

The standing committee on health and family welfare said practitioners of modern medicine systems do not have much faith in AYUSH and often question their credibility and scientific validation. This is despite India being knowledge repository of traditional medicine since ages, it said.

“The committee, accordingly, recommends to the ministry to take concrete steps in introducing modules of modern system of medicine in the curriculum and pursue the ministry of health and family welfare for introducing similar modules of AYUSH systems of medicines in their MBBS course,” the committee report tabled in Parliament last week said.

An integrated approach will help understand the strengths of each system of medicine and increase the credibility of AYUSH, the report said.

“The need of the hour is to streamline the AYUSH systems of medicine by standardization and quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy drugs and improving the quality of education and healthcare services through AYUSH,” it said.

“At the same time, the curricula of both modern systems of medicine and AYUSH system need to be changed in such a way to strive for integration in the study of medical education itself followed by cross system referrals and integrated healthcare services,” it said.

Mixing courses of different systems of medicine is not rational, commented Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis-C-DOC Centre for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. “However, Ayush doctors can have short stints in hospitals to know various types of patients. An MBBS aspirant should only stick to science-based medicine course as previously,” said Misra. Previously too, in several articles published in Lancet in 2016, Misra had expressed doubts over the efficacy of Ayurvedic drugs claimed to treat diabetes.

Recently, health ministry has started co-locating AYUSH facilities at public health centres, community health centres and district hospitals. The committee also noted that AYUSH doctors are also participating in the National Health Programme and public health outreach activities and research activities undertaken to facilitate integration of Ayurveda and allopathic systems of medicine.

According to a study by the Delhi University’s Institute of Economic Growth published in PLOS One journal in 2017, only 6.9% of all patients who sought outpatient care used AYUSH, 3.5% used Indian systems of medicine such as Unani and Siddha, and 3% used homoeopathy. The study was based on a nationally representative health survey 2014 with the total sample size of 65,932 households (36,480 rural and 29,452 urban) comprising of 333,104 individuals (189,573 rural and 143,531 urban).

“This is consistent with the fact that use of allopathy treatment is more common and that there is hardly any differentials in use pattern across rural and urban India. Also, allopathy care accounted for over 90% of outpatient care across key socioeconomic and demographic variables,” the study said. “Overall, AYUSH utilization in India (about 7% of outpatient care) appears to be on the lower side when compared to some of the previous estimates or general perceptions,” it further said.

The study found that the use of AYUSH among middle-income households was lower when compared with poorer and richer households. AYUSH care utilization was higher among patients with chronic diseases and also for treating skin-related and musculo-skeletal ailments, the study observed.",AYUSH modules should be made part of MBBS courses: parliamentary panel,"['courses', 'health', 'panel', 'committee', 'parliamentary', 'care', 'system', 'systems', 'modern', 'welfare', 'ayush', 'modules', 'study', 'mbbs', 'medicine']","The parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare pointed out that it is often seen that practitioners of modern system of medicine do not have much faith in AYUSH system.

New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set to improve its tally in the Rajya Sabha, winning 28 of the 59 seats that went to polls this year.

Rajya Sabha election results declared Friday showed that the BJP won nine of the 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Karnataka, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

While 33 Rajya Sabha seats witnessed no election, 26 went to polls on Friday. Of the 33 elected unopposed, 16 were from the BJP, three from its allies and five from the Congress, among others.

The Rajya Sabha election results showed that incumbent regional parties in states such as West Bengal and Telangana continue to perform well.

The BJP’s performance ensures that its dominance as the largest party in the Upper House continues, though the NDA is still short of a majority.

The biggest loser from Uttar Pradesh is the Samajwadi Party (SP), which had six out of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats that went to polls. It retained only one seat, that of Jaya Bachchan.

The BJP won a historic mandate in the Uttar Pradesh elections last year—giving it an edge in the Rajya Sabha elections this year. The party’s gains come at the cost of the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP, which was voted out of power last year.

Union finance minister Arun Jaitley is among the BJP candidates who has entered the Upper House from Uttar Pradesh.

The counting of votes was delayed in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Karnataka following complaints by members from different political parties.

In Karnataka, the Congress won in three out of four seats, while the BJP’s tally got reduced to one seat. Overall, the Congress’ gain was on two seats in the state while the BJP lost out on one.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the BJP’s candidate from Karnataka for Rajya Sabha, polled the highest votes, with 50 legislators favouring his candidature. Congress candidates L. Hanumanthaiah, Syed Naseer Hussain and G.C. Chandrasekhar got elected. Seven Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, rebels were allowed to vote despite the party having asked the speaker to disqualify them from the voting process. The seven JDS legislators had defied the party whip in the 2016 Rajya Sabha elections and are all set to join the Congress party on Sunday.

In West Bengal, the chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) maintained its tally by retaining four seats. In the fifth, Congress’ Abhishek Manu Singhvi won. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, lost out on one seat that it held earlier.

The TMC’s Subhasis Chakraborty, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Nadimul Haque, and Santanu Sen won. Singhvi, who was backed by the TMC, received 47 votes. The CPM’s Rabin Deb, who was backed by other Left parties, lost.

In Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) won all three Rajya Sabha seats without any hitch. Its winning candidates were Banda Prakash, Lingaiah Yadav and Santosh Kumar. The Congress lost out on two seats which it held earlier.

In Jharkhand, the Congress managed to retain one seat it held earlier and the BJP gained one seat. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) lost out on the one seat it held before the Rajya Sabha elections.

The BJP maintained status quo in the one seat that went to polls in Chhattisgarh. The party’s national general secretary, Saroj Pandey, defeated the Congress’s Lekhram Sahu.

In Kerala, leader of Sharad Yadav-led Janata Dal (United) splinter faction, M.P. Veerendra Kumar, won with 89 votes. He was supported by the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which has 91 seats in the 140-member state assembly.

The lone seat had fallen vacant because of Kumar’s resignation from the Rajya Sabha in December, in protest against JD(U) chief and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar joining ranks with the NDA.

Six members of Kerala Congress (Mani) abstained from voting. The lone BJP member, O. Rajagopal, and independent member P.C. George also abstained. One member of the Indian Union Muslim League could not vote due to ill-health.

New Delhi: The ministry of electronics and information technology on Friday issued a notice to London-based analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, seeking response on issues related to data of Indians collected by the firm or its intermediaries or associates.

The government has sent six questions to the company and have sought responses by 31 March, failing which it may entail legal action, ministry said in a statement.

Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of the Facebook data breach controversy where data of 50 million users in the US was compromised to benefit Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.

The IT ministry notice seeks clarity from Cambridge Analytica whether it engaged in any assignment to utilize data of Indians in regards to the breach. The government has also sought the details of the entities who have engaged the firm for any intention to profile and influence voting behaviour.

According to a statement by IT ministry, such a notice was sent out to the accused company as the government is “deeply concerned about such developments and is committed to ensure the protection of the fundamental right of privacy and safety and security of data for every citizen of India”.

“While the government is cognizant of the positive role played by social media in promoting awareness and acting as a tool for social cohesion and empowerment; breach of privacy cannot be tolerated,” the statement added.

The IT ministry also said that CERT-In, the national nodal agency that deals with cybersecurity threats, has issued an advisory which lays down best security practices to be followed by social media users in order to safeguard personally identifiable information on social network sites.

On Thursday, Ovleno Business Intelligence Pvt. Ltd (OBI), the Indian affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, denied use of any data collected from the public without their consent for any of its political analysis. OBI vice-president Himanshu Sharma also denied having worked with Cambridge Analytica on any project related to social media.

All intermediaries and their associates have the legal obligation to maintain security, confidentiality and sanctity of data and any unauthorized use of data can entail legal action, the ministry statement said.

Mint on Friday reported that the government is planning to come up with a long-term strategy to secure data on Indians, especially those using social media.

On Wednesday, IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had accused the Congress of indulging in “theft of online data” to help with its election campaigns. He had also warned Facebook of stringent legal action if it was found misusing data on Indians.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in turn, targeted the BJP-led union government saying that the party has “invented story on Congress and data theft” to deflect attention from the controversy over 39 Indians who died in Iraq.",India issues notice to Cambridge Analytica in Facebook data breach case,"['data', 'notice', 'social', 'legal', 'users', 'india', 'cambridge', 'case', 'analytica', 'breach', 'facebook', 'indians', 'ministry', 'statement', 'issues']","The government notice also sought information on entities which engaged Cambridge Analytica, the method used by it for possession of data and whether consent was taken from users.

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday set aside the disqualification of 20 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs for holding offices of profit as ‘parliamentary secretaries’ in the Delhi government, and sent the case back to the Election Commission (EC) for a fresh hearing.

A 19 January opinion by EC and the subsequent presidential order disqualifying the MLAs was quashed by a bench comprising justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar for failing to comply with the principles of natural justice.

“Order of remand is passed to EC to hear arguments and thereafter decide all important and seminal issue—what is meant by the expression ‘office of profit held under the government’ and re-examine the factual matrix to decide whether petitioners had incurred disqualification on appointment as parliamentary secretaries, without being influenced by the earlier order or observations on the said aspect in this order,” the judgment read.

The court quashed the disqualification order on the ground that EC had not given the MLAs an oral hearing and an opportunity to address arguments on their proposed disqualification.

AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal welcomed the ruling.

“Truth has won... Delhi high court has given the people of Delhi justice...,” Kejriwal said on Twitter. He later met the 20 AAP MLAs.

“Unless we see a certified copy of the court order, we would not be able to comment on it,” chief election commissioner O.P. Rawat said.

Eight of the 20 disqualified AAP MLAs had moved the high court on 23 January.

The disqualified MLAs are—Alka Lamba, Adarsh Shastri, Sanjeev Jha, Rajesh Gupta, Kailash Gahlot, Vijendra Garg, Praveen Kumar, Sharad Kumar, Madan Lal Khufiya, Shiv Charan Goyal, Sarita Singh, Naresh Yadav, Rajesh Rishi, Anil Kumar, Som Dutt, Avtar Singh, Sukhvir Singh Dala, Manoj Kumar, Nitin Tyagi and Jarnail Singh.

A single-judge bench of the high court had on 24 January directed the EC to maintain status quo on the disqualifications by withholding announcement of bypoll dates for the Delhi assembly seats that would fall vacant as a result.

After the case was transferred to a two-judge bench on 29 January, it was heard on a day-to-day basis until the court reserved its judgement on 28 February.

In March 2015, the Delhi government had appointed 21 MLAs as parliamentary secretaries. Since then, one MLA resigned from the assembly. The appointments were made to assist cabinet ministers and also include more MLAs in governance work.

Bengaluru: The All India Veershaiva Mahasabha on Friday said both Veershaiva and Lingayats were one and condemned the Karnataka government’s decision to carve out a difference between the two.

“This is an attempt to break the community,”said Shyamnur Shivashankarappa, president of the Mahasabha, considered by many within the community as its representative body.

However, the Mahasabha said that they do not oppose the minority religion tag accorded to the community.

The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka had passed a cabinet decision on Monday aiming to split the Lingayat community--believed to single largest community in the state--votes that has largely sided with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The cabinet’s decision comes at a time when the Congress is taking measures to stall the BJP’s efforts to return to power in Karnataka in the upcoming assembly elections due later this year.

The cabinet note had mentioned that those Veershaiva’s who follow Basava Thathva (teachings of 12th century social reformer Basavanna) will be considered as Lingayats.

By mentioning both Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats separately, the cabinet chose to introduce some level of ambiguity into the original recommendation to pacify disgruntled Veerashaivas community, who feared being left out of the separate minority religion movement led by water resources minister M.B. Patil.

The 113-year-old Mahasabha called the move of the government mischievous and pursued with electoral gains in mind.

“The (state) government is responsible for all this mischief,” N. Thippanna, senior vice president of the Mahasabha said.

The representative body said that it had given a memorandum to the centre in 2013 seeking to get a religious minority status for Veershaiva and Lingayats. The centre is yet to decide on the memorandum and the Mahasabha will request the centre to move this request forward.","Lingayats and Veershaiva one and the same, says All India Veershaiva Mahasabha","['india', 'minority', 'karnataka', 'community', 'centre', 'decision', 'cabinet', 'religion', 'lingayats', 'veershaiva', 'mahasabha']","Karnataka The Mahasabha, however, said it do not oppose the minority religion tag accorded to the community.

New Delhi: Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood on Friday said he had discussed the issue of alleged harassment of Pakistani diplomats stationed in India with his government and they would like to sort it out “as soon as possible”.

Mahmood, who came back to India on Thursday, almost a week after he was called back home for consultations amid an war of words over the harassment of Indian diplomats in Pakistan and Pakistani diplomats in India, said such issues affect the relation between the two countries.

“I discussed this issue (harassment of Pakistani diplomats in India) with our government. We want to sort out this issue as soon as possible because it affects relations between the countries,” Mahmood told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised to mark Pakistan’s National Day in New Delhi. The event commemorates the passing of the famous Lahore Resolution on March 23, 1940, when the All-India Muslim League demanded a separate homeland for the Muslims of British India. It was also on 23 March in 1956 that Pakistan was declared an Islamic republic.

Mahmood was called home for consultations after reported remarks by the Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Faisal Mahmood that the Indian government failed to take notice of the increasing incidents of intimidation of Pakistani diplomats, their families and staff by its intelligence agencies. India and Pakistan have accused each other of harassing diplomats in Islamabad and New Delhi respectively.

The spike in tensions due to the cases of harassment and intimidation has dimmed hopes of a thaw between the two countries, sparked by Pakistan accepting proposals from India for the exchange of elderly, sick and women prisoners earlier this month.

On Friday, Mahmood also said that all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the Kashmir dispute, can be resolved through dialogue, which will usher in an “era of peace and stability” in South Asia.

This came as Pakistan’s president Mamnoon Hussain, in a speech in Islamabad, accused India of violating the 2003 ceasefire agreement between the two countries saying the Indian government’s actions had put regional peace at stake. Referring to cross-border ceasefire violations, Hussain accused India of human rights violations in Kashmir. “With these actions, Pakistan’s neighbour has put the regional peace at stake,” he was cited as saying by PTI.

Calling upon for an immediate and peaceful resolution of the struggle of Kashmiri people, Hussain said, “The only solution to the dispute of Kashmir is to provide the right of self-determination to Kashmiris, and Pakistan will continue to play its role in this regard.” He said that Pakistan was ready to extend a hand of co-operation to regional countries, but “taking it as a weakness will be a dangerous mistake.”",Pakistan high commissioner says Islamabad seeks to sort out diplomat harassment issue soon,"['diplomats', 'sort', 'mahmood', 'peace', 'issue', 'india', 'soon', 'islamabad', 'pakistan', 'pakistans', 'regional', 'harassment', 'commissioner', 'pakistani', 'countries', 'seeks', 'high', 'diplomat']","Photo: AFPNew Delhi: Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood on Friday said he had discussed the issue of alleged harassment of Pakistani diplomats stationed in India with his government and they would like to sort it out “as soon as possible”.

Mumbai/New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday conducted searches at the Mumbai headquarters of Financial Technologies of India Ltd (FTIL), and the residences of Jignesh Shah (former chairman of FTIL), as well as those of former chairmen of the erstwhile Forward Markets Commission (FMC)—in connection with alleged irregularities in granting recognition to the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) as a national commodity exchange, said two people aware of the development.

In an emailed response, FTIL, now known as 63 Moons Technologies Ltd, said the search was in connection with the matter of permission granted to MCX in 2003, and added it has full faith in the judiciary. “We find this surprising as the permission was granted 15 years ago when the country did not have a pan-India commodity exchange. The permission to set up a nationwide commodity exchange was not only granted to MCX but also three others—NCDEX, NMCE and N-BOT,” said a spokesperson for 63 Moons.

“We have already been forced to exit MCX in 2014 and all documents related to the permission are obviously with MCX. Despite this, the search is being conducted on us and our chairman emeritus (Jignesh Shah),” he said.

“During the search at Shah’s residence on Friday, CBI did not find any single incriminating material and/or document. The agency is being misled by vested interests trying to divert attention from the truth getting established,” he added.

“CBI has initiated an inquiry into the clearance given by the Forward Markets Commission to MCX to become a nationwide exchange, even though MCX was not fulfilling stipulated criteria,” said a CBI spokesperson.

The MCX spokesperson could not be reached for comment.

According to the second person mentioned earlier, a total of nine individuals and two firms—63 Moons and MCX—are under investigation. Apart from Shah, the other eight names include Joseph Massey, former deputy managing director of MCX, four former chairmen of FMC (one of them later joined Securities and Exchange Board of India), and three other FMC officials.

Calls made to Massey for a comment were not answered.

Mint is not naming the others as we could not reach out to them for a comment.

“Jignesh Shah and FTIL illegally retained shares beyond the permissible limit of 26%, thereby deriving wrongful gain of Rs137 crore by selling 26 lakh excess shares at Rs1,032 per share,” said the second person quoted earlier.

This is the third CBI case against FTIL and Shah. CBI has registered a chargesheet against the two in the Rs5,574.35 crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) scam for allegedly defrauding two public sector commodities trading firms—PEC Ltd and MMTC Ltd. CBI is also probing a case of alleged irregularities in according recognition to MCX-SX by capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in 2008 and further renewing the recognition in 2009 and 2010.

MCX, promoted by Shah, was to launch an IPO in 2009-10, but postponed it owing to the global financial meltdown.

Mumbai: Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 plunged to five-month lows on Friday as jittery investors rushed to sell shares on heightened fears of a trade war after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese imports. The sharp sell-off in Indian markets was part of the global meltdown, as global risk aversion intensified.

During the day, both the Sensex and the Nifty shed over 1% of their value, while the latter dipped below the 10,000-mark. The Sensex closed at 32,596.54, down 409.73 points, or 1.24%, while the Nifty ended at 9,998.05, down 116.70 points, or 1.15%. The Indian benchmark indices have fallen over 10% from life highs touched on 29 January.

Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said the market slump seems to be a bit of an overreaction, coming at a time when year-end considerations were weighing on markets anyway. “Weak domestic factors, coupled with trade war fears, may further drag the markets if a recovery is not seen by Monday. If the markets break crucial support levels, it will lead to further selling and take the Nifty to 9,650,” he said.

Markets worldwide were under pressure, following weakness in the US markets. Markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea have slipped 2-4%, while European markets opened lower.

Trump has instructed US trade representative Robert Lighthizer to impose broader tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, as recompense for alleged intellectual property abuses. In response, China said it does not fear a trade war with the US and announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the US.

Sonal Varma, chief India economist and Aurodeep Nandi, India economist at Nomura, said that although marginal, India is also exposed to a slowing China and increased US trade protectionism; there is room for a policy response.

“The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been building forex reserves as a means of self-insurance from financial-stability risks and will use them to defend the rupee if needed. The monetary policy stance is neutral and rates can be hiked to rein in inflation expectations, but given balance-sheet concerns, we do not expect aggressive rate hikes,” they wrote in a report.

Sahil Kapoor, chief market strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research, said risks to global trade are real and tremors in the markets are just a reflection of that.

“The total size of global trade is about $20.8 trillion and all the participants benefit from it. The magnitude of tariffs imposed currently are small but could have other repercussions. Currently, we are still at an early stage to understand nuances of trade war, but if it happens, the global recovery may have to write its obituary faster than expected,” he added.

The sharp sell-off in markets follows an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee, meeting for the first time under new chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point.

Policymakers continued to project a total of three interest rate hikes this year. The central bank projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019, implying three rate hikes next year, compared with two 2019 moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December. Higher interest rates in the US generally lead to outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets considered to be riskier assets.

However, analysts do not see any impact on the foreign fund flow into India but are worried that the markets are likely to correct further due to both global and domestic factors. “We are looking for further correction till about 9,600 levels. Currently, Indian markets are trading at 17 times on one-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) basis. At 9,600 levels, we feel valuations will become attractive. We continue to be bullish from longer term perspective,” said Kapoor.

According to Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, the markets have to navigate both domestic and global headwinds now. “Besides trade war fears, US bond yields are also hardening, which may constrain RBI from cutting rates. This is going to cause turbulence, while political anxiety in India is going to add to volatility,” he said.

However, Bodke also added that India is at the cusp of revival in earnings, which is likely to comfort markets and debt resolution by some of the stressed firms are positive factors for the markets.

“The markets are close to fair valuations,” he added. Currently, the Sensex is trading at 17.40 times its expected earnings for the current fiscal, which makes it one of the most expensive gauges among peers.

So far this year, the Sensex and Nifty slipped 4-5%. FIIs have bought Indian shares worth $1,659.90 million, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have pumped in Rs19,689.53 crore so far in 2018.

208,ONGC may buy out GAIL in OPaL,https://www.livemint.com/Money/mPXslhiRPbKSjhbhtnEecN/ONGC-may-buy-out-GAIL-in-OPaL.html,GAIL had picked up 19% stake in OPaL in Gujarat’s Dahej but the project faced major cost overruns which forced it to restrict its equity contribution to Rs996.28 crore,"ONGC’s petrochemical complex in Dahej. People privy of the developement said GAIL is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in the project at Rs996.28 crore.

New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.

GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.

But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs996.28 crore.

This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17%, then to 15.5% and now about 9%, sources privy to the development said.

“It doesn’t make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,” they said.

The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs30,000 crore.

After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19% stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date.

People privy of the development said when project cost was revised to Rs19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company’s board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs1,000 crore.

Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But when the project cost went up further to Rs21,396 crore, the promoter’s equity contribution increased from Rs5,860.5 crore to Rs6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio.

GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved—Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5% stake. Now that the project cost almost touched Rs30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9% stake.

Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5% stake, did not make more equity contributions.

Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s National Agricultural Development Co., part owned by the sovereign wealth fund, will acquire Danone SA’s venture in the country, creating one of the kingdom’s largest dairy producers.

Nadec, as the company is known, will fund the acquisition of privately held Al Safi Danone through a capital increase of 536 million riyals ($143 million), it said in a statement to the Saudi stock market Sunday. Once the deal is completed, existing Nadec shareholders will own 61.25% of the company, and Al Safi shareholders will hold 38.75%.

“The transaction will allow both companies to better serve customers and realize benefits not available on a standalone basis,” Abdulaziz Al Babtain, managing director of Nadec, said in the statement. “It will create a platform for future growth and, importantly, drive significant value creation for shareholders.”

Nadec shares rose as much as 8.4% to 40.70 riyals ($10.86). They closed at 39.38 riyals ($10.51), the highest since September 2014.

Merger and acquisition activity in Saudi Arabia is picking up as slower economic growth encourages companies to combine to save costs, while new takeover rules make it easier to complete deals.

Sahara Petrochemical and Saudi International Petrochemical Co. said they were evaluating a merger earlier this month. HSBC Holdings Plc-backed Saudi British Bank and Alawwal Bank, in which Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc owns a 40% stake, are in talks to merge, as are hospital operators Al Hammadi Co. for Development & Investment and National Medical Care Co.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

San Francisco/Singapore:Uber Technologies Inc. has reached an agreement to sell its Southeast Asian ride-hailing business to rival Grab and could announce the deal as early as Monday morning in Singapore, people familiar with the matter said.

The agreement—which includes all of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia as well as Uber Eats in the region—gives Uber a stake of between 25% and 30% in the new combined business, the people said, asking not to be identified ahead of an official announcement.

The deal, which Bloomberg outlined earlier this month, marks Uber’s operational exit from yet another major market and hands a victory to Grab as it battles local competitor Go-Jek.

SoftBank Group Corp., a major backer of Grab’s and Uber’s as well as China’s Didi Chuxing, has pushed consolidation to improve the profitability of a global ride-hailing business that bleeds billions of dollars a year. New entrants and the strength of second-place regional players such as Lyft Inc. in the U.S. has complicated those efforts.

Representatives for Grab and Uber declined to comment.

The deal represents another major retreat from international markets for Uber. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive officer, sold Uber’s business in China in 2016 in return for a 17.5% stake in Chinese ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing. Then Uber agreed to sell its Russian business to Yandex—just before after Dara Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive.

Khosrowshahi has been pushing to clean up the company’s financials in preparations for an initial public offering next year. Pulling out of markets like Southeast Asia would boost profits at a company that has burned through $10.7 billion since its founding nine years ago. Khosrowshahi signaled during a trip through Asia last month that he is committed to key markets such as Japan and India.

Photo: Reuters

New Delhi: Looking to provide an impetus to the early-stage startup ecosystem, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) plans to increase the maximum investment by angel funds in venture capital undertakings to Rs10 crore from the current Rs5 crore.

In this fast changing ecosystem, wherein angels are investing much higher amounts, such increase is needed to provide more opportunities to angel funds, regulatory officials said. However, the minimum investment by an angel investor will continue to be Rs25 lakh.

Further, Sebi plans to halve the minimum corpus size required for an angel fund to register with it to Rs5 crore. The regulator is considering to raise the maximum period of accepting funds from an angel investor to five years from the present limit of three years, they added.

The move will provide angel funds more time to identify opportunities and invest in venture capital firms. The issue will be discussed at the board meeting of Sebi this week. Angel funds, a sub-category of alternative investment funds (AIFs), encourage entrepreneurship in the country by financing small startups at a stage where such firms find it difficult to obtain capital from traditional sources of finance such as banks and financial institutions.

In addition, angel funds offer mentoring to entrepreneurs as well as access to their own business networks. Currently, 398 AIFs are registered with Sebi, of which 114 are registered under category I, including eight angel funds.

In line with the Companies Act, the regulator is looking to amend Sebi (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) norms and Sebi (Banker to an Issue) regulations that will enable a registrar as well as banker to an issue to maintain records of books of accounts and documents for a minimum period of eight years after completion of the relevant transactions.

Besides, Sebi plans to provide an option to listed companies for distribution of cash benefits—dividend of equity and preference shares as well as interest and maturity proceeds on debt instruments—through the depositories in addition to the present system of distribution either directly by them or through the registrar to an issue and share transfer agents.

At present, there is a restriction on listed companies availing services of depositories for distribution of cash benefits.","Sebi looks to boost startup funding, plans to ease rules for angel funds","['ease', 'minimum', 'angel', 'sebi', 'rules', 'funds', 'issue', 'plans', 'boost', 'provide', 'rs5', 'startup', 'looks', 'present', 'regulator', 'funding']","Sebi also plans to halve the minimum corpus size required for an angel fund to register with it to Rs5 crore.

New Delhi: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering to come out with new norms on share buyback programme, under which maximum limit for share repurchase will be 25% of the company’s paid up capital and other reserves.

The company may buyback its shares and other securities from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis through the tender offer; open market via—book building process and stock exchange—and odd-lot holders, senior officials said.

This will be applicable provided that no offer of buyback for 15% of the paid up capital and free reserves of the company will be made from the open markets. The proposal will be discussed at the board meeting of Sebi this week, they added.

The regulator plans to come out with a consultation paper on the share and other securities buyback programme and seek public comments on the same. The final regulations will be put in place after taking views of all the stakeholders. Under the proposal, the maximum limit of any buyback would be 25% or less of the aggregate of paid up capital and free reserves of the company.

Besides, the ratio of the aggregate secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buyback may not be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves. According to the proposal, the company would not buyback its shares to delist its scrips, besides, the firm would not repurchase its scrips through negotiated deals, whether on or off the stock exchange through spot transactions or through any private arrangement.

“A company shall not make any offer of buyback within a period of one year reckoned from the date of closure of the preceding offer of buyback,” as per the proposal. The company may not be allowed to purchase its own shares through any subsidiary company and any investment company. Further, the firm would not directly or indirectly purchase its own shares if a default is made by it.

However, such buyback would not be prohibited if the default is remedied and period of three years has lapsed after such default ceased to subsist. If a company completes buyback of its shares, it will not make a further issue of the same kind of scrips including allotment of new shares within six months except by way of bonus issue or in the discharge of subsisting obligations such as warrants, stock option schemes and conversion of preference shares or debentures into equity shares.

The companies will have to complete their buyback offers within a period of one year of passing a special resolution by the general meeting or the special resolution passed by the board of directors.

New Delhi:Markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering to reduce the additional expenses charged by mutual funds by 15 basis points, a move aimed at increasing penetration of such products among investors.

The proposal, based on an internal study by Sebi on mutual funds, will be discussed at the regulator’s board meeting this week, senior officials said.

As per the proposal, the additional expense of 20 basis points may be reduced to 5 basis points across all mutual fund schemes and this need to be reviewed every two years, they added. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had permitted mutual funds to charge 20 basis points of assets under management of the scheme in lieu of exit loads, or the sum mobilised from investors when they offload holdings.

In case of open ended equity and balanced schemes, the additional expenses charged are significantly higher than the actual credit back of exit load to the scheme.

In comparison, these additional charges are lower in the case of open-ended debt schemes. Across all open ended equity and balanced schemes, an average exit load of around 5 basis points has been credited back whereas an average additional expense of 18-20 basis points has been charged to such schemes.

The regulator is also looking to amend the regulatory framework to enable disclosures related to mutual funds in investor-friendly electronic form.

Under this, mutual fund houses need to prominently disclose on a daily basis the total expenses charged to customers for all schemes under a separate head on their websites.

Besides, they need to communicate to investors latest net asset value (NAVs) through SMS following a request from the unitholder.

Bengaluru: The maker of Bira 91, a popular Indian craft beer with bottles sporting sketches of a quirky monkey with a punk hairdo, is aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) in the next three to five years, its chief executive told Reuters.

B9 Beverages, founded and led by New Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations in a country where marketing of alcohol is heavily regulated.

Jain puts it down to the fact that the taste of beer matters to Indian consumers now much more than before. “Younger consumers have a different perception about alcohol,” he said.

Craft beer sales are on the rise in India as younger, affluent consumers in big cities choose brands and pubs that make lighter brews and promise fresher ingredients.

Bira expects its India business to break even in fiscal 2019 and revenue to more than double to about Rs400 crore.

Set up in 2015, B9 Beverages initially manufactured Bira 91—the name references India’s international phone code—in Belgium but supply chain snafus and high costs made it difficult to compete against market leaders Kingfisher, SAB Miller India and Carlsberg.

The supply issues were resolved, Jain said, after he started production in India in late 2016. The company still sources toddy for Bira’s wheat variant, Bira White, from Canada or Europe to ensure quality.

The idea to start the business grew out of Jain’s personal search for good-quality beer after he repatriated to India from the US, where craft beer is hugely popular.

After sputtering efforts to get his fledgling company off the ground, Jain received investments from local venture capitalists and, later, from US-based Sequoia Capital.

Jain, owns 35 percent of the company.

B9 has raised about $30 million in four funding rounds so far. Jain said the company had sufficient funds and was not looking to raise money in the short term.

Still niche

Euromonitor International pegged beer sales in India at 3.1 billion litres last year and expects it to grow to 3.3 billon litres this year.

Jain reckons Bira 91 has a 5% share of the beer market in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Notwithstanding Bira’s success, craft beer is expected to remain a niche market in India in the near future as stronger brews remain a firm favorite, especially in smaller cities, and cost conscious consumers pick cheaper alternatives.

A 330 ml bottle of Kingfisher Strong Premium, which has 8% alcohol content, sells at Rs68 in Bengaluru. In contrast, a bottle of Bira White, with 4.9% alcohol, retails at Rs110.

Bira recently launched a variant with 7% alcohol content.

While the company has a headstart in the domestic craft beer market, it is expected to face competition from global rivals and other Indian brands looking to enter the market.

Bengaluru-based United Breweries Ltd, which dominates the Indian beer market with its Kingfisher Strong beer, has said it plans to launch a craft beer brand by the end of 2018.

But Jain is upbeat about Bira’s prospects.

“We are beginning to see a data point where Bira is not just sort of dominating premium, but actually taking share away from mass market brands. So consumers are actually trading up, paying more for beer that’s more flavourful and resonates with them.” Reuters",Bira beer maker B9 Beverages planning IPO in 3-5 years,"['consumers', 'indian', 'beverages', 'india', 'bira', 'craft', 'b9', 'ipo', '35', 'planning', 'alcohol', 'jain', 'share', 'maker', 'beer', 'market']","Bira 91, founded and led by Delhi-based entrepreneur Ankur Jain, has quietly snagged market share through word-of-mouth recommendations.

219,Jerome Powell moves to normalize US monetary policy,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/YMRg9zJSXMK9yvRyeiOLEO/Jerome-Powell-moves-to-normalize-US-monetary-policy.html,The strengthening economic outlook for the US economy augurs well for the global economy,"Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint

All eyes were on Jerome Powell this week as he chaired the federal open market committee (FOMC) meeting for the first time since taking charge of the US Federal Reserve. How different will he be from his immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke? And how will his monetary policy complement the fiscal expansion by the Donald Trump administration? Both these issues have profound implications for the global economy.

As expected, the committee that sets US policy interest rates increased them by 25 basis points. Apart from the policy action, financial markets all over the world were looking for the accompanying commentary and future projections of key economic indicators. It will also be interesting to see how the Fed’s communication evolves under Powell. He gave brief and direct answers in his first press meet while indicating that he would hold more press conferences. This should help improve the market’s understanding of the Fed’s position as it moves forward on the path of normalization.

Meanwhile, the projections released by the rate-setting committee showed that it expects a total of three rate hikes this year. However, the number of participants who expect four rate hikes has gone up compared to the December meeting. The committee also expects rates to go up at a faster pace next year compared to its December projections. While the FOMC raised its projection for economic growth and expects the unemployment rate to come down further, it kept its inflation projection unchanged for the current year and next year. However, it revised its core inflation projection, mildly overshooting the target of 2% in 2019.

The Fed expects the US economy to grow at 2.7% in the current year and 2.4% in 2019. The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 3.6% in 2019. Powell explained that while the unemployment rate has come down from the highs of the 2008 recession, inflation has not gone up, indicating that the relationship between inflation and unemployment—as captured by the Phillips curve—has weakened. As things stand today, this would mean that interest rates in the US will not go to the level seen before the financial crisis in the foreseeable future. The median projection for the federal funds rate in 2020 stands at 3.4%, compared to the high of 5.25% seen in 2006.

Nevertheless, there are at least three broad takeaways for the global financial market and policymakers from Powell’s first FOMC meeting as Fed chair.

First, the strengthening economic outlook for the US economy augurs well for the global economy. Continued recovery in the global economy will also help other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, to gradually unwind their crisis-era policies and move towards normalcy. The strength of the US and global economy will also support the ongoing recovery in the Indian economy.

Second, although the Fed expects to gradually raise rates, global financial markets may still find higher rates difficult to handle. For instance, the three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is at its highest level since 2008. Trillions of dollars worth of debt and interest rate derivatives are anchored to Libor. Higher rates could affect confidence and lead to higher volatility in financial markets.

Higher interest rates could also make debt servicing more difficult for a large number of leveraged firms across the world. Analysing a global sample of 13,000 companies, S&P Global Ratings recently found that the proportion of highly leveraged entities was 37% in 2017 compared to 32% in 2007. Also, the non-financial corporate debt has gone up by 15 percentage points, globally, to 96% of the gross domestic product between 2011 and 2017 (goo.gl/ba2P35). These companies will be in greater difficulty if the Fed raises rates at a faster pace. Although inflation has remained subdued in recent years, the possibility of a pickup in prices on the back of fiscal stimulus and lower unemployment cannot be completely ruled out. Higher rates could also lead to portfolio rebalancing by international investors. Foreign investors, for example, have sold bonds worth over $2 billion in Indian markets over the last one month.

Third, while the risk of tightening financial conditions is roughly balanced at this stage, the global economy is facing a bigger threat from rising protectionism. In his remarks, Powell also noted that a number of FOMC members reported that businesses are concerned by the change in US trade policy. More protectionist measures by the Trump administration could lead to retaliation by trading partners, which will inevitably affect medium- to long-term prospects for global trade and growth.

Ten years after the financial crisis, even as the Fed is carefully moving towards normalizing policy—though it may have to move faster if inflation surprises on the upside—the risk for the global economy at the moment is populist measures by the US government.

Moscow: Messaging service Telegram Group Inc., which smashed the world record for selling a new cryptocurrency in February, is on track to raise another $850 million as its initial coin offering (ICO) extends toward a third month, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Investors are placing sufficient orders in the second round even after the token was priced at more than triple last month’s level, two of the people said, asking not to be identified as the offer is private. Appetite for crypto-assets has cooled somewhat since market leader bitcoin failed to return to its January highs, they explained.

The comments signal that the ICO is going mostly according to plan for Pavel Durov, the self-exiled Russian entrepreneur who founded the encrypted-chat app with his mathematician brother Nikolai in 2013 and now boasts 200 million users from Iran to Brazil.

The firm, registered in the British Virgin Islands, is finding enough interest among a global pool of investors who have been rocked by a volatile token market and whose sceptics say they doubt the Durovs can meet their goal to speed transactions processing toward a level of Visa or Mastercard.

Telegram raised $850 million from large investors last month, selling rights to virtual coins called Grams at $0.38 apiece, according to a filing. The second round is targeting another $850 million at $1.33 apiece this month, according to the company documents seen by Bloomberg News. Telegram didn’t respond to Bloomberg inquiries seeking comment.

The company is seeking to build is own blockchain network with Gram built-in, enabling much faster transactions speed than rival networks run for bitcoin and ethereum. It’s raising funds to build this network, rent servers, boost the number of users and pay operating expenses, the documents say.

Kolkata: Shares of private lender Bandhan Bank would get listed on both the NSE and the BSE on 27 March after its initial public offering (IPO) was oversubscribed by 14.6 times.

Gold prices gained as much as 1% on Friday on a faltering dollar and equities as investors scurried to safety after US President Donald Trump moved towards long-promised anti-China tariffs, prompting a strict response from China amid fears of a global trade war.

Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list is published.

China urged US to “pull back from the brink”, while the Chinese commerce ministry unveiled plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of US imports in response to the steel and aluminium tariffs.

Uncertainties around a possible trade war between US and China are driving some safe-haven buying, said Hareesh V, head of commodity research, Geojit Financial Services.

Spot gold was up 0.81% at $1,339.33 per ounce, as of 1.28pm. Earlier in the session, prices touched their highest since 20 February at $1,343.06, and were on track for their best weekly performance since the week of 16 February, rising over 2%. US gold futures for April delivery rose 0.9% to $1,339.50 per ounce.

“A trade war will harm both the US and Chinese economies... And any harm to the US economy will depreciate the dollar pushing gold higher,” said Ji Ming, chief analyst, Shandong Gold Group.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was down 0.2% at 89.72. The yen hit a 16-month high against the dollar on Friday as concerns over rising global trade tensions triggered a bout of investor risk aversion.

Investor appetite for a safe-haven asset such as gold rises during times of geopolitical and financial uncertainties, and a weaker greenback makes the dollar-priced bullion less expensive for purchasers with other currencies.

“I think the prices will move higher again... If prices can stabilize above $1,360 that would be an early signal for a strong rally,” Hareesh said.

Stock markets slid on Friday and perceived safe havens such as government bonds and the yen gained.

Meanwhile, EU leaders were awaiting for the final word from Trump on whether the United States would apply tariffs to European steel and aluminium, said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and warned of a firm response if he did.

“We opine that retaliatory tariffs will potentially create further more uncertainty over how global growth and trade may pan out into 2018, and could drag risk appetite further,” analysts at OCBC Bank said in a note.

Among other precious metals, silver climbed 1% to $16.52 per ounce, while platinum was 0.9% higher at $955.30 per ounce.

Mumbai: Union Bank of India on Friday hit 11-year low after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a Rs1,394.43-crore bank fraud case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure Ltd on a complaint by the state-run bank.

The stock fell as much as 9.11% to hit a low of Rs86.05, a level last seen on 8 March 2007. At 1.18pm, the scrip was trading at Rs86.95 on the BSE, down 8.2% from its previous close. So far this year, it declined 40%, while the Sensex fell over 4%.

“The company had diverted funds by opening accounts outside the consortium and through payments of wages by showing excess expenditure and inflated stocks. The entire sale proceeds were not allegedly routed through the dealing branches of consortium banks,” Mint reported.

The fraud came to light a day after CBI registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain for allegedly defrauding State Bank of India (SBI) and 13 other banks to the tune of Rs824.15 crore.

Earlier, Punjab National Bank unearthed a scam of $2 billion where billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders.

New York: Crude took a turn lower amid an equity selloff largely pinned to growing apprehension about a potential trade war with China.

Futures edged down 1.3% in New York on Thursday after topping $65 a barrel this week for the first time since early February. US stocks fell and Treasuries jumped as President Donald Trump formally ordered tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, stoking fears of retaliatory measures by the Asian giant.

“It’s simply a risk-off type of day for all global risk assets,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “Considering the scope of yesterday’s rally, a little bit of a pullback shouldn’t come as all that much of a surprise.”

The decline in crude prices is probably a temporary blip. OPEC’s output reductions have lowered inventories, with stockpiles in the US falling below the five-year average for the first time since 2014. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley sees London-traded Brent crude reaching $75 a barrel by the third quarter and also said geopolitical risks tend to be exacerbated when the supply cushion is thin.

West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery dropped 87 cents to settle at $64.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent for May settlement slid 56 cents to end the session at $68.91 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $4.61 premium to WTI.

“If you have more tariffs and restrict trade, there’s just less movement in the economy,” said Mark Watkins, who helps oversee $142 billion in assets at Park City, Utah-based US Bank Wealth Management. Such a slowdown “would potentially lower the overall demand for oil.” Bloomberg",Crude drops as Donald Trump tariffs on China spark trade war concerns,"['tariffs', 'concerns', 'spark', 'york', 'lower', 'took', 'selloff', 'turn', 'drops', 'trump', 'crude', 'donald', 'china', 'barrel', 'trade', 'war']","Crude took a turn lower amid an equity selloff largely pinned to growing apprehension about a potential trade war with China.

Tokyo: A regulatory rebuke for one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges is giving Bitcoin investors the jitters.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency issued a warning to Binance for operating cryptocurrency exchange services with Japanese residents through the internet without a licence in the country, according to a statement on the agency’s website. Bitcoin fell as much as 4.5% after the Nikkei first reported the warning on Thursday, and was down 0.2% at 9:31 am in Hong Kong on Friday.

Binance, founded by Zhao Changpeng, was warned because it had several staff in Japan and had been expanding without official permission, according to a person familiar with the FSA’s plans, who asked not to be named because the information is private.

The news adds to signs that governments around the world are stepping up scrutiny of cryptocurrencies amid worries that they’re facilitating everything from money laundering to tax evasion and fraud. Japan, one of the most active markets for digital assets globally, introduced a licensing system for virtual currency exchanges last year in an effort to improve oversight.

Binance told Bloomberg in January that it was working to acquire a license in Japan, but the warning could complicate those efforts. Zhao said on Thursday that the exchange is “engaged in constructive dialogue” with the FSA. While Binance was founded in Hong Kong last year, Zhao has said that his company does not currently have a legal headquarters anywhere in the world.

The FSA has been clamping down on cryptocurrency venues in the wake of a $500 million theft from Japanese exchange Coincheck Inc. in January. Last month, the regulator issued an administrative penalty against Macau-based Blockchain Laboratory Ltd for giving seminars and providing consultation services in Japan without a license. Earlier this month, it suspended several local venues for poor security measures.

Binance has consistently ranked as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume since late last year, according to Coinmarketcap.com. It held the top volume ranking for the past 24 hours, trading about $1.6 billion, the website shows.

New Delhi: The Rajya Sabha on Thursday approved the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2018, enabling the government to raise the limit of tax-free gratuity and to fix the period of maternity leave qualifying as continuous service period through an executive order.

Once the gratuity bill is signed into law by the President, the government will be in a position to raise the tax-free gratuity for public and private sector employees from Rs10 lakh at present to Rs20 lakh, which government employees are eligible for after the implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations.

ALSO READ: How gratuity amount is calculated

An official statement from the ministry of labour and employment said the Payment of Gratuity Bill ensured harmony among employees in the private and public sectors as well as autonomous organizations who are not covered under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules. “These employees will be entitled to receive higher amount of gratuity at par with their counterparts in government sector,” said the statement. The pro-worker move comes at a time of various anti-government protests from farmers, traders and labour unions.

The labour ministry said that the decision to amend the law was taken after considering inflation and wage increase in the private sector. “After enactment of the Act, the power to notify the ceiling of the amount of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 shall stand delegated to the central government so that the limit can be revised from time to time keeping in view the increase in wage, inflation and future pay commissions,” said the statement.

The amendment enables raising the maximum limit of gratuity to such amount as may be notified by the government from time to time, it added.

The law is applicable to employees who have completed at least five years of continuous service in an establishment that has 10 or more persons. Fifteen days’ wage for every completed year of service subject to the ceiling is given as gratuity.

The amended bill also allows the government to raise the maternity period eligible as continuous period of service for gratuity purposes from 12 weeks to such period as may be notified from time to time. The government had earlier amended the Maternity Benefit Act of 1961 to raise maximum paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks by an amendment last year.

Ensuring sufficient retirement savings for workers is important for policymakers as the elderly population has been growing at twice the pace as the general population in the last decade. This trend could necessitate higher public spending on healthcare.

According to a 2016 report by the Central Statistics Office, the elderly population of 60 years and above expanded at the rate of 35.5% during 2001-2011, while the growth rate in the general population was slower by half at 17.7%.

Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

In every conference call held in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s quarterly result, the launch of tildrakizumab was a key point discussed. The Halol plant’s non-compliant regulatory status was another. It’s a bit of a surprise then that its shares yawned at the announcement that the firm got a novel drug approval for Ilumya, the brand name for tildrakizumab.

This could be a case of the news already in the price but this was by no means a slam dunk, as seen from the conversations in these calls.

There is the possibility that the company’s continuously flagging US sales growth and inability to clear the Halol hurdle has made investors circumspect, even in the face of positive news. At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

Ilumya is good news in that light, becoming a key contributor to US revenues eventually. This drug was licensed by Sun Pharma from Merck and Co. in 2014, by paying an initial sum of $80 million and while Merck did the work and filings to bring it to market, Sun Pharma has borne all costs.

It has worldwide rights for this product and has out-licensed it for Europe. Sun Pharma will pay Merck milestone-related amounts (the approval itself will trigger a payment) and then royalty on sales that will range from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.

Sun Pharma deserves a pat for getting its licensing candidate right, which targets a large market opportunity. In recent calls, Sun Pharma’s management has said its marketing organization for Ilumya is in place, and some field force recruitments are already done. That means related investments and expenses, to an extent, are already in its expenditure.

Initially, Merck will supply the product and later Sun Pharma will shift production to a third-party facility. Sun Pharma’s management had said that the investment phase for Ilumya—where the company will spend more than it will sell—may last for 1.5-2 years.

In the US, the market for psoriasis drugs is a sizeable one. For instance, Janssen Biotech Inc.’s Stelara earned $4 billion in global revenues in 2017. Janssen also launched a product Tremfya, which is in the same sub-category of IL-23 products, as Sun Pharma’s Ilumya. There are some concerns too, on whether too many products are crowding this market, whether Tremfya will be preferred over llumya, and also positive trial data for a new product risankizumab (being developed by AbbVie Inc.).

In response to a question that asked the revenue potential from speciality products, Sun Pharma’s managing director Dilip Shanghvi said that IL-23 and IL-17 (different sub-categories of immunology products targeting diseases such as psoriasis) are being sold by very large companies with more experience in speciality biologics than Sun Pharma. While the company may not have the same success the large firms may have (in turning it into a blockbuster drug), Shanghvi said it has a good product and sees no reason to not try and match those revenues. He also clarified that the current spend is not geared to handle that kind of volume and upside but Sun Pharma will take that decision closer to market.

After its March quarter results, the management will give a guidance for FY19, which should factor in the impact of Ilumya’s launch. Sun Pharma will probably share some details on its plans for the product and its future. Investors are keeping their hopes low. Whether they are surprised by the management’s guidance remains to be seen. The company has passed a key near-term milestone with the Ilumya approval. Sun Pharma’s investors seem to be fixated more on its ability to get the Halol facility compliant for them to change their cautious view.","Sun Pharma: One down, Halol to go","['products', 'pharmas', 'merck', 'pharma', 'halol', 'management', 'product', 'revenues', 'ilumya', 'market']","At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.

230,"As formalization lags, logistics firms pin hopes on GST e-way bill, better implementation",https://www.livemint.com/Money/clMiB9PeV5GbahcqD7T38O/As-formalization-lags-logistics-firms-pin-hopes-on-GST-ewa.html,"Given the omissions and fragmented structure of the logistics sector, implementation of the GST e-way bill in the current form may not spur a rapid transition in the short term","GST still holds promise for the logistics sector, but much depends on the implementation. Photo: PTI

The goods and services tax (GST) that was expected to fast-track the formalization of the logistics sector is proving to be a rather gradual process. Mahindra Logistics Ltd recently told SBICAP Securities Ltd that GST has only led to a gradual shift from the unorganized to organized logistics, unlike the disruptive change that was expected initially. As goods transport agencies largely remained under the reverse charge mechanism (in which they do not have to register under GST and pay lower taxes) the shift towards organized sector was stymied, says Sandeep Mathew, an analyst at SBICAP Securities.

The scenario is expected to change as the government implements the e-way bill beginning next month. E-way bill is an electronic documentation aimed to track goods movement and prevent tax evasion under GST. Compliance is expected to benefit the organized logistics sector. But given the omissions and fragmented structure of the sector, implementation of the e-way bill in the current form may not spur a rapid transition in the short term, some fear.

Deepal Shah, chief executive officer (customs clearance and freight forwarding) at Avvashya CCI Logistics Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Allcargo Logistics Ltd, says transport agencies (a segment in logistics sector) could slow down the transition, as they enjoy special taxation status and other exemptions. “With the current changes in e-way bill implementation, there have been a lot of exceptions in the eligibility criteria for an e-way bill requirement,” adds Shah.

An analysis by Aseem Chawla, partner at Phoenix Legal, and his team, says that the e-way bill by itself may not fast-track the transition to the organized sector as the e-way bill requirement for the transporter is not linked with mandatory registration for transporters under the GST.

“Further, at present, there is no requirement to generate e-way bill where an individual consignment value is less than Rs50,000, even if the transporter is carrying goods of more than Rs50,000 in a single conveyance,” said the study by Chawla and his team.

P.C. Sharma, CEO of TCI Express Ltd, reasons that the transition will take time as the industry was heavily dependent on the unorganized sector. Further, with the final form of the e-way bill yet to take shape, one should wait for changes, he adds.

Of course, the e-way bill is still evolving and is expected to be implemented in a phased manner. As the implementation gathers pace, the formalization of the logistics sector is expected to gain momentum. Some are already seeing the initial benefits in consolidation of warehouses and realignment of supply-chains.

But the need of the hour, as Sharma of TCI Express says, is proper implementation and a focused approach towards the reforms.

Shah of Avvashya CCI Logistics says compulsory registration under GST and implementation of the reverse charge mechanism in a phased manner can ensure better compliance and faster transition from unorganized to organized logistics. Overall, while GST still holds promise for the logistics sector, much depends on the implementation.","As formalization lags, logistics firms pin hopes on GST e-way bill, better implementation","['hopes', 'transition', 'gst', 'goods', 'logistics', 'pin', 'firms', 'bill', 'eway', 'lags', 'implementation', 'organized', 'formalization', 'expected', 'sector']","E-way bill is an electronic documentation aimed to track goods movement and prevent tax evasion under GST.

Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017.

Of course, it is certain that Mahindra has not given up the battle. In a recent Investor Day presentation at Mahindra Research Valley, the senior management focused on the auto business. The host of launches lined up in the UV segment in the coming months indicates that the company hopes to stage a comeback and regain its lost market share. But this is easier said than done.

Note that when Maruti Suzuki was steadily conquering the UV market by tweaking its range and launching relatively cheaper compact UVs, such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis, Mahindra was caught napping. Lack of products in the compact segment was its biggest failure. And now, the road ahead is arduous and rife with competition. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. is a strong competitor with deep pockets. It has garnered nearly a fifth of the UV market in just two years. There is also Toyota Motor Corp. that is keen on expanding its presence in the Indian market from the present 12%.

Therefore, Mahindra’s struggle would be far greater than what it was seven years ago, when it was the market supremo. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “If Mahindra is targeting a market share of 30% in UVs, it appears achievable.” That said, it is highly unlikely that the company will regain its stronghold with a 50%-plus market share in UVs.

Add to this, the costs of advertising and marketing to keep abreast of competition especially from Maruti Suzuki—whose reach is relatively greater—might dent profitability unless the new launches rake in strong sales volume. As such, the share of its auto division in the overall Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) has declined from two-thirds to one-third, ever since it lost ground in UVs. Profit margins have ebbed too.

Thankfully, Mahindra’s farm equipment division’s stellar growth rate over the last two years on the back of a favourable monsoon and a growing rural economy, has partially offset the pain in the auto division.

From an investor standpoint therefore, FY19 would be the make or break year for the auto segment. With Maruti Suzuki being a strong force to contend with and in the lead position, it is a tough road ahead for Mahindra.

This explains why Mahindra’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has been sticky at around 17, in spite of two strong growth years for the farm equipment division.",Mahindra on rough terrain as Maruti Suzuki grabs No. 1 slot in utility vehicles,"['market', 'auto', 'terrain', 'utility', 'suzuki', 'vehicles', 'grabs', 'strong', 'slot', 'share', 'mahindra', 'uv', 'rough', 'segment', 'uvs', 'maruti']","Maruti Suzuki has steadily captured the utility vehicle market from Mahindra by tweaking its range and launching compact UVs such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis.

The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well.

Reliance Jio’s relentless aggression isn’t limited to its pricing strategy; there is no end in sight to its capacity for investments in the telecom sector.

Based on recent data presented in the Lower House of Parliament, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate that Reliance Jio has a 62% share of the combined data capacity of the country’s big four mobile companies. In other words, its capacity is about 1.6 times the capacity of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd combined.

But according to an analyst at another institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio also carries about two times the data traffic these three companies manage between themselves.

As such, Reliance Jio too needs to augment capacity to support growth, which it indeed is busy doing. The company has told analysts it will increase the number of base stations to around 200,000 in the next few quarters, or by about 25% from current levels. The above-mentioned analyst says that channel checks with suppliers suggest the count will go up to as high as 250,000 eventually.

What all of this means is that incumbents need to step up investments to keep up pace.

“Even as we do not think incumbents need to match Jio on data capacity anytime soon, we do believe they need to accelerate their efforts in closing the gap. This may mean elevated levels of capex for the next two-three years, in our view, posing upside risks to capex forecasts,” Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients.

This comes at a time when cash flows are drying up. Idea generated next to nothing in terms of cash last quarter, and that was before a series of tariff cuts by Reliance Jio in January. Needless to say, the increasing gap between cash flow and capital expenditure needs to be funded through other means.

So it isn’t surprising that all operators are busy with asset sales, equity/bond issuances or a combination of both. Airtel has periodically sold stakes in its tower infrastructure company and is even considering listing its Africa business to generate funds.

234,Will Sebi’s latest plan to curb algo-trading backfire?,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/SDemKEZFLazUkhdfTmLZ7H/Will-Sebis-latest-plan-to-curb-algo-trading-backfire.html,"Sebi would do well to articulate the regulatory intent behind the congestion fee, as things can quickly get out of hand, if it’s not implemented carefully","The silver lining in the latest algo-trading proposal is that it isn’t as bizarre as, say, the two-queue proposal Sebi flirted with for years to bring parity between sophisticated traders and less sophisticated traders.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a proposal to impose a congestion charge to curb algorithmic traders who send large numbers of order messages to stock exchanges. If it isn’t implemented carefully, the market regulator will be playing with fire. A wrongly calibrated message fee can impact liquidity and increase bid-ask spreads, and will hurt the very investors Sebi is trying to protect.

But first, the congestion fee proposal, or any regulation for that matter, begs the question: What market failure is the regulator trying to address? According to a person familiar with the regulator’s thinking, the congestion charge is similar to a traffic tax that seeks to reduce congestion on roads.

Some algorithmic traders send a large amount of orders to exchanges, which are later either cancelled or modified, and don’t end up in actual trades. The case for a congestion fee, according to this person, is to disincentivize traders who clog exchange systems with a disproportionately high amount of orders. After all, high-message traffic necessitates higher investments by exchanges for enhancing trading infrastructure and surveillance capacity, and imposes costs on other market participants and the regulator as well. As such, it makes sense for such costs to be borne proportionally by those who are imposing these burdens on the marketplace. A message fee fits well in this scheme of things.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) has charged market participants a message fee for years now, although the clearly stated intent there has been to recover its market surveillance costs. A drop in order-to-trade ratios has been one of the fallouts of Asic’s move, although this was more of a by-product. Its cost recovery fee is calibrated at levels that help it meet its budget for market surveillance.

To start with, Sebi would do well to articulate the regulatory intent behind the congestion fee clearly. It needs to state where order-to-trade ratios are at currently, how it compares with other markets, and why it sees them as detrimental to the market.

And importantly, it needs to provide a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed congestion fee. Market-making firms that use algo-trading tools are quick to point out that such fees will invariably impact firms that provide liquidity to the markets. Market makers aim to provide two-way liquidity, while at the same time maintaining low inventory levels. If the market moves against them, they are among the quickest to cancel existing orders in the system.

If the regulator sets a message fee at a level that is seen as unviable by some traders, many of them would think twice about posting passive orders which can potentially be cancelled at a later stage. The firms that continue with market-making activities will demand higher spreads, which will hurt all investors. If things turn out this way, Sebi’s move will be counterproductive.

Clearly, the message fee needs to calibrated in a way that it doesn’t impede market makers who provide much-needed liquidity to the markets. Currently, Indian exchanges penalize traders whose order-to-trade ratios are higher than certain prescribed limits such as 50:1. But while calculating the ratio, exchanges exclude orders that are placed within a +/- 1% range from the last traded price. The aim behind this is to support market makers and penalize only those traders who unnecessarily clog exchange systems with orders that are unlikely to get executed.

Should Sebi consider a similar system with the message fee? Venkatesh Panchapagesan, associate professor, finance and accounting, at IIM Bangalore says that a 1% range applied to all stocks may not be effective in curtailing high messaging traffic, something he finds in a study he did with researchers at Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. According to him, the fee should be levied based on the volatility of a stock/index, so that only genuine liquidity providers are excluded. The regulator could also consider excluding passive orders if they had remained exposed for a finite period of time, he adds.

The silver lining in the latest algo-trading proposal is that it isn’t as bizarre as, say, the two-queue proposal Sebi flirted with for years to bring parity between sophisticated traders and less sophisticated traders. But even with the congestion fee, things can quickly get out of hand, if it’s not implemented carefully.

235,Doing business in India: ‘Substance’ over ‘form’ in transfer pricing regime,https://www.livemint.com/Money/AKgbWMYckiqHKzNvcCdjPK/Doing-business-in-India-Substance-over-form-in-transfer.html,"Although ‘substance over form’ has always been the guiding principle for any transfer pricing analysis in India, the new BEPS regime has further brought it into limelight","The new three-tier documentation structure for transfer pricing aims at providing access to the revenue authorities on information pertaining to operations of multinational enterprises. Photo: iStockphoto

International taxation has witnessed some major changes in recent times. Many of these changes are attributable to the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

This project was a result of the public outcry in different parts of the world to address rising BEPS issues, including double non-taxation/low taxation in context of global firms. The result was an elaborate set of recommendations in the form of 15 reports with regular updates from OECD.

Accordingly, a three-tier documentation structure was recommended for transfer pricing. These include country-by-country (CbC) reporting, master file and local file.

The new three-tier documentation structure aims at providing access to the revenue authorities on information pertaining to operations of multinational enterprises (MNEs).

Earlier, Indian revenue authorities used to focus on comparability of companies adopted by the taxpayer, the arm’s length nature of margin earned by the taxpayer on routine information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) transactions, etc. Now, the availability of enhanced information as per the new documentation structure will help revenue authorities focus on a more macro-level review of the MNE’s business operations. This will also help them with an in-depth analysis of the functional, asset and risk (FAR) profile and the economic characterization of entities involved in the intra-group transactions.

Under Indian regulations, CbC reporting is applicable on MNE groups having consolidated group revenue of more than Rs5,500 crore (approximately $850 million). Master file reporting is applicable on MNE groups having consolidated group revenue of more than Rs500 crore (approximately $80 million) and cross-border related-party transactions in excess of—(a) Rs50 crore (approximately $8 million) at an overall level; or (b) Rs10 crore (approximately $1.6 million) only related to intangible assets.

The first cycle of reporting deadline is 31 March in India. This has put pressure on MNEs to collate humongous and some hard-to-source data, and ensure timely reporting. Armed with the group-level information, the revenue authorities may come up with an extensive set of follow-up questions.

Use of data analytics and related IT tools would further help them in demanding more explanations and justifications on the overall business structures and tax positions taken by the businesses. The taxpayers may find the overall experience of dealing with more informed revenue authorities a little overwhelming. Therefore, MNEs need to evaluate their existing structures for the foreseeable BEPS risks and take appropriate remedial action.

MNEs need to examine their value chain proactively to identify possible mismatches between location of economic activity, and the resultant value creation, to avoid any disputes at a later date. They also need to review the actual conduct of their various group entities, rather than focusing merely on documentation or paper trails in the form of inter-company agreements to justify their intra-group transactions. Although “substance over form” has always been the guiding principle for any transfer pricing analysis in India, the new BEPS regime has further brought it into limelight.

For instance, parking of intangibles in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, with no economic substance in such entities, could be a potential BEPS risk area. Revised guidance requires that a FAR analysis or capacity re-assessment be carried out for such entities. This will help in evaluating whether they have the capability to perform intangible related functions (such as development, exploitation, etc.,) and bearing the associated risks (such as financial risk, obsolescence risk, failure risk, infringement risk, etc.,) or are mere shell entities to avail tax benefits.

Another typical situation wherein similar risk may arise can be an intra-group services scenario, which is quite common in Indian context. The taxpayers would need to substantiate the capability of service providers to render services in terms of availability of necessary resources like fixed assets, employees with relevant skill sets, etc.

The need of the hour is not only to revisit the entire supply chain from a transfer pricing perspective in isolation, but to adopt a more holistic approach with focus on substance over form.

Transparency between revenue authorities and taxpayers has been one of the pillars of the BEPS work. The revised transfer pricing documentation structure has been created as one of the enablers to achieve this objective. In the long run, MNEs need to be more careful and cautious in their approach to any structuring/re-structuring exercise and take necessary corrective steps, wherever required. After all, prevention is better than cure!

FAQs

Should multinational enterprises (MNEs) stop paying attention to the structure or language of intra-group pacts and simply focus on nature of actual transactions while undertaking any transfer pricing analysis?

Intra-group agreements often serve as the starting point for a transfer pricing analysis. They help in gathering basic understanding of how a transaction is structured. Although the revised guidelines focus on facts of the actual transaction, inclusion of any clause in an intra-group agreement that is not in alignment with the actual transaction may result in unnecessary dispute and litigation. A more pragmatic solution, therefore, would be to restructure the transaction to cover any BEPS-related risks and thereafter align the intra-group agreement with the actual transaction.

Very often, MNE group structures have marketing support entities, which are remunerated at total cost plus fixed mark-up. Can the business/pricing model of these entities be challenged even if they are not involved in or perform the function of final conclusion of contracts?

One needs to evaluate the functions, asset and risk (FAR) profile of such entities and the actual conduct of their employees. A mere shifting of contract conclusion function to principal risk bearing entity, i.e. from one tax jurisdiction to another tax jurisdiction may not be sufficient. Any material involvement of such marketing support entities in the critical sales functions needs to be evaluated as the same may lead to possible permanent establishment (PE) risks or the conclusion that different pricing models (like revenue split or profit split or commission based model) other than a simple cost plus are more suited to such entity.

Once the existence of a PE has been established, does it mean the entire profit resulting from the underlying economic activity should be attributed to the PE only?

Even if a PE is established in India, the entire profits should not be subject to tax in India. It is only the profits that are attributable to the PE which are taxable in India. Therefore, the taxpayer needs to evaluate the role played by the PE before doing such profit attribution exercise. Once there is clarity on the FAR profile of the PE, the TP principles would be used to decide the quantum of attribution. Profit needs to be attributed only for that portion of FAR for which no income has been offered to tax in the concerned tax jurisdiction.

236,Market volatility will rise in short-term as elections near: Rana Gupta,https://www.livemint.com/Money/k8IhJldawk6kQRpdDJT2JJ/Market-volatility-will-rise-in-shortterm-as-elections-near.html,"Rana Gupta, managing director, Indian equities, with Manulife Asset Management on the rise of political risks ahead of polls and its impact on Indian companies and markets","The bankruptcy code was one of the most remarkable rule changes the country has seen, says Gupta.

The earnings of Indian companies are recovering and the country is witnessing green shoots in various sectors, Rana Gupta, managing director, Indian equities, with Manulife Asset Management, said in an interview.

“When we talk to corporates, we get a sense that the rural economy, which was not doing so well in the past few years, is seeing green shoots. We can also see other indicators like auto sales, commercial vehicles sales, cement among other sectors,” he said.

Gupta also dismissed the return of political risk as a long-term concern, but added that this could lead to increased volatility in the markets in the near-term.

According to him, most medium-term risks to India come from external factors—crude prices, lack of exports growth and agriculture output being volatile and erratic.

Edited excerpts:

When you look at some of the news and conversations from India, is the return of political risk a concern? Is this a medium-term concern for the country?

In the next 12 months, we will see very important state elections and then we’ll have the central elections, and so political risks will rise. We do not see it as a long-term concern, but in the short and medium term, market volatility will surely rise.

In terms of it being a concern, it depends on the investment horizon—for those with medium- and long-term horizons, like us, it is not a big concern, as the economy is picking up, and that should help core operating growth.

If you take a step back and take a long-term view, you’ll see that subsequent governments have continued with the good work of the previous government.

But short-term volatility is not ruled out at all. Most medium-term risks to India come from external factors—first is the crude prices. If this goes up, India’s trade deficit expands, current account deficit expands and the rupee weakens.

If we look at why that is happening, it is because, all this while, one of India’s weakness has been lack of growth in exports. That remains an area of concern that has to be worked upon.

Another medium-term concern is agriculture—subsequent governments have worked on it, but over a period of time, agriculture output has been erratic and volatile.

Globally, if trade wars escalate, do you see inflation making a comeback in India?

We have to wait and see. If, going forward, the US imposes more tariffs on Chinese goods, that will lead to higher inflation in the US. Now, whether that inflation will be a globalized phenomenon, and impact India as well, will depend on the kind of retaliation that comes from the trading partners—if the latter also imposes tariffs and import duties, then it becomes a globalized phenomenon. While there can be a risk of trade wars leading to higher inflation and lower growth, you have to wait and see.

When you look at India from here, is ad-hoc policymaking a concern? Does it appear that the country does not take into account the unintended consequences before it enacts policies—be it the recent move asking banks to scrutinize all advances above Rs50 crore, or the ban on promoters and related parties from bidding for auctioned assets under the new insolvency code—there are several other examples.

We look at this a bit differently. Let us take the case where promoters and related parties were banned from bidding for auctioned assets. This may seem ad-hoc, but there was a need to address this problem.

The bankruptcy code was one of the most remarkable rule changes that the country has seen—now bad assets go through resolution and a new entity takes it over, and they become operative in the longer-term—it is a positive step.

This is the first time that this has been attempted in India—it is a massive structural change.

Now, could the new rules be more foolproof, and could it have been better?

Yes.

But a start has been made, and there were gaps in this policy—the government responded to it to plug them. It may seem a bit messy for a while, but when you do this kind of structural change, this is bound to happen. But the bigger picture is that this is a very big long-term structural change.

Will the Punjab National bank (PNB) scam lead to tighter regulations in the banking sector, and will this, in turn, hurt credit growth? Where do public-sector banks go from here?

Yes. After the PSU (public-sector) bank recapitalization, which was a positive step, we had turned bullish on credit growth from PSU banks.

Post the PNB scam, and as there are some other investigations happening, we’ve dialled down.

We do think that credit growth from PSU banks will not be very high, and for sectors such as gems and jewellery, the impact will be big.

Barring the top one-to-two PSU banks, I am afraid there is not much to look forward to from this space. They still have quite a bit of bad loans and while they’ve got capital from the government, that may not be enough, and they need to raise some on their own—we do not think that this will happen immediately. So, barring the top 1-2 PSU banks, the going will get very tough.

The Indian equity market still seems expensive despite the recent correction. Are valuations a concern?

The way we look at it, after the correction, India’s one-year forward P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) has come down to 16—this is a little higher than its long-term average.

In times of good earnings growth, we see that a bit higher than average P/E can be sustained. This time around, whether we can sustain a higher P/E will depend on local and global factors.

The P/E ratio in the context of operating earnings of growth is reasonable—we don’t find it expensive, but we are mindful of the global and local developments.

We are emphasizing on operating profit because we think reported profit growth will disappoint. On 12 February, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came out with a circular asking banks to end several forms of loan recast—the provisioning cost will be very high for banks going forward, and that will erode the earnings growth projected by everyone.

So, reported earnings growth will be much lower than what the market is expecting—this is a one-off provision that will happen only in 2018-19, and may be reduce significantly thereafter.

Therefore, for this year, we are only looking at operating earnings profit growth.

Overall, has earnings really come back? The recovery we are seeing in the earnings growth over the last couple of quarters—are the green shoots real? We’ve been discussing this for past three years.

Yes, but let us focus on the operating earnings level. Operating earnings profit is coming back—if you look at the reported numbers for the past two quarters, Nifty operating profit grew 15% year-on-year.

We’ve already had two quarters of double-digit earnings growth, and going forward, at the operating level, we think that it will be sustained.

When we talk to corporates, we get a sense that the rural economy, which was not doing so well in the past few years is seeing green shoots.

We can also see other indicators such as auto sales, commercial vehicles sales, cement among other sectors.

When you talk to Indian corporates, is there a divergence on how you look at the country and how they see it?

Sitting here in Singapore, it is difficult to figure out why the economy has picked up because all the indicators you look at—broad macro indicators—gives you some sense that growth has revived.

But when you talk to corporates who are primarily in the consumer-focused businesses, whether it is rural or urban, you get a sense that the consumption growth is now broadening out.

What has happened was that, because of demonetisation and GST, the organized sector had gained a lot, largely in urban areas.

That gain is broadening out.

Corporates have been telling us that they are seeing green shoots in rural areas as well—for example, given the kind of industrial output we see, it was difficult for us to understand why commercial vehicles are doing so well.

When we talked to the corporates, and let me be candid—sitting here, we did not get to see this—because of GST, the logistics structure is getting into a hub and spoke model—therefore, the commercial vehicles operators are shifting to either high tonnage vehicles, or a lower tonnage one. There are many bottom-up examples—from rural growth to commercial vehicle industry, falling credit cost for rural-focused non-bank companies—all of these are not very obvious when sitting here.

What is your take on the sectors that have a high exposure to the US—such as pharmaceuticals, information technology (IT), steel, gems and jewellery?

Most of the gems and jewellery companies are not listed. Steel does not have a very high exposure to the US—they have indirect exposure. As of now, the tariffs that have been imposed is a very small portion.

As far as IT and pharmaceuticals, with respect to US protectionism, so far nothing has happened. We will not pre-empt this. Fundamentally, we like IT. We see that for IT, after three years of underperformance, we see some bottoming out.

Investors positioning in IT is light and expectations are low, and we think that while IT companies may not give you great numbers, they may beat modest expectations.

On pharmaceuticals, this sector is where IT was about a year ago. Maybe the downside is limited, but it is a very slow rebuilding process as many of the plants for the large pharmaceutical companies have still not cleared. At the same time, we don’t see much of an upside either.

What does India need to do to get foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to change their mind and again come back in a big way?

Yes, FII inflows to India have not been strong. A couple of things need to happen—first, from a broad macro perspective, the GST revenues, while it has stabilized, it is running below the budgeted rates, which is causing worries that fiscal deficit will be higher than expected.

Our view is that, with the economic buoyancy that we had spoken about, GST numbers will get there.

Second, bond yields in India have risen a lot—if RBI acts and helps cool off some of those high yields, that will also be positive.

Third is crude price. If it goes up to $70 (a barrel), FIIs will be concerned. On the other hand, if it falls to $60 (a barrel), investors will see that as a positive. The longer-term solution to this is to increase exports. Again, long-term solution towards having a stable GDP is to reform agriculture so that the volatility goes away.",Market volatility will rise in short-term as elections near: Rana Gupta,"['operating', 'near', 'concern', 'market', 'growth', 'india', 'shortterm', 'banks', 'longterm', 'higher', 'elections', 'rana', 'earnings', 'rise', 'gupta', 'high', 'look', 'volatility']","Gupta also dismissed the return of political risk as a long-term concern, but added that this could lead to increased volatility in the markets in the near-term.

237,Asia’s dollar problem just got worse,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/OhMpWZnwHBdjsERCJWtZrN/Asias-dollar-problem-just-got-worse.html,Asia’s export-reliant economies will be collateral damage from any exchange-rate stunts from the Trump White House,"On 24 January, Team Donald Trump made official its plan for a dollar devaluation, thus ending the 23-year-old strong-greenback policy. Photo: Reuters

The best way to destroy the capitalist system, Vladimir Lenin said, is to debauch the currency.

While Lenin didn’t live to see arch-rival America do just that, another Russian leader named Vladimir—Putin—is revelling in Donald Trump’s dollar debauchery.

Smart people can debate what role Putin played in putting the reality-television star in the White House. But there’s no disputing Trump’s dollar devaluation plans. Ironic, really. A US president so openly hostile to Mexico angling to morph the dollar into the “peso”.

No region is more on front lines of the dollar’s descent than Asia. Its export-reliant economies will be collateral damage from any exchange-rate stunts from the White House.

The same goes for the disorder likely to emanate from Trump’s latest staffing gamble: hiring Lawrence Kudlow as top economic adviser.

On 24 January, Team Trump made official its plan to end the 23-year-old strong-dollar policy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rocked the currency world when he said: “A weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.” The yen’s 6% surge this year, a move that threatens Tokyo’s reflation efforts, speaks to the dangers of Washington taking a beggar-thy-neighbour turn.

Then last week, Trump hired CNBC host Kudlow, 70, to be the economic voice in his head. Confusing, considering Kudlow is a rabid strong-dollar enthusiast. After a stint at Ronald Reagan’s White House in the 1980s—Reaganites, remember, are hard money people—Kudlow served as chief economist at Bear Stearns. Confusing, too, because he doesn’t have an economics degree.

Kudlow is a supply-side ideologue, a cheerleader for the dogma of low taxes, less regulation, free trade and a strong currency. Now, he’s the brain trust and lead spokesman for a president who abhors the last two of these four core ideals. How will this fly in debates with Trump and Mnuchin?

The plot thickens when you factor in Jerome Powell, the new head of the Federal Reserve. Powell has telegraphed about four interest rate hikes this year. US data since then—including 313,000 new jobs added in February—augur in favour of tighter credit conditions.

Trump’s is as chaotic a White House as the world has ever seen. Might markets face public debates among Trump and his team about whether the dollar should plunge or rally? A volatility-inciting Trump-Mnuchin versus Kudlow-Powell brawl?

Stranger things have happened in Trumpworld, often emanating from Trump’s early-morning Twitter habits. Xi Jinping’s China is often a target of Trump tweetstorms, as is Japan at times.

Early in Trump’s first year in office, Toyota Motor Corp. came in for criticism for opening a new factory in Mexico rather than America. A declining yen, at the time, also came in for Trumpian finger-lashings here and there.

All Asia can really do is batten down the hatches, policy-wise, and brace for the fallout. In the Trump age, says economist Barry Eichengreen of University of California, Berkeley, markets “have no way to forecast the impact of policies, because policies thought to be headed one way suddenly veer in the opposite direction. A big infrastructure bill turns out to be small. Withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement turns into a possible decision to re-enter TPP.” And then Mnuchin, he says, “seemingly abandons the strong-dollar policy but then re-embraces”.

It’s policy whiplash of the kind one might expect from, say, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. That it’s happening in the biggest economy and protector of the linchpin of global commerce—the dollar—raises the spectre of financial anarchy. It hardly helps that Trump, 14 months in, takes Washington’s rarified position for granted.

Trump, remember, was elected in part by railing against a massive debt build-up under predecessor Barack Obama. Of course, Obama took office just as the subprime crisis was savaging the US economy. A fiscal jolt was needed. Trump just borrowed $1.5 trillion from future generations to fund tax cuts for plutocrats. Were Japan to do that, credit-rating agencies would be announcing downgrades. Next time, though, rating companies might not be so tolerant. Kudlow is already talking about new tax cuts the economy doesn’t need.

But the real worry is trust in the dollar. When Mexico blew up in 1994, Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998 and Europe in 2010, investors rushed into the safety of dollars. Team Trump is busily damaging that hard-won credibility—to the benefit of Putin and Xi. As Lawrence Summers, an architect of the 1995 strong-dollar policy, writes in The Washington Post: “The confidence of global markets is much easier to maintain than to regain.”

That confidence is being squandered by White House chaos. “There are decades where nothing happens,” to double back to another Lenin quote, “and there are weeks where decades happen.” Last week was the latter, as Trumpland made it impossible for Asia to discern whether the dollar is headed sharply lower or higher this year. Debauchery, indeed.

Mumbai: The volatility in Indian stocks in the past few weeks is expected to impact the valuations of small and medium-sized companies that are preparing to launch their initial public offerings (IPOs).

Since 2015, a majority of the 94 companies that have launched IPOs for listing of their stocks on the main boards of exchanges are small and medium-sized companies, data from stock exchanges shows.

In the secondary markets, small-caps and mid-caps have been the biggest losers in the recent months, resulting in depressed sentiment for IPOs from these segments, industry experts said.

Year-to-date, the BSE Midcap index has lost 10.73% and the BSE Smallcap index 11.27%, underperforming the 3.08% loss in the benchmark Sensex.

“The mood has been down in the last couple of weeks in the secondary markets and the political economy is also not looking very good. So sentiment is weak and that will definitely impact valuations,” said Prithvi Haldea, chairman of primary market tracker Prime Database.

Haldea added that people were willing to pay for stretched valuations when the Sensex was rising from 28,000 points to all the way up to 35,000-36,000 points.

“But now due to the fall in the stock prices of your peer group, your valuation will also take a hit,” he said.

The post-listing performance of recent IPOs in this volatile market has also been a mixed one, adding to the softening of sentiment.

Of the six companies that were listed since January, three are trading below their issue price. These include Aster DM Healthcare Ltd, Newgen Software Technologies Ltd and Apollo Micro Systems Ltd.

According to industry experts, given the prevalent market conditions some small- and mid-cap companies could even face difficulties in launching IPOs.

“People have disproportionately lost money in small and mid caps. People who started marketing their transactions two months back, the valuations then and the valuations in the secondary market today are starkly different. So a lot of small- and mid-cap deals will face pressure in launching given the gap between promoter’s valuation expectation and what investors are willing to pay,” said an investment banker working on several IPOs. He requested anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.

In these markets, investors would prefer investing in existing stocks in the listed universe rather than new ones coming in the IPO market, and thus small- and mid-cap companies going for IPOs will have to offer higher discount on valuations, he added.

Companies and investors can expect volatility to continue given the several state elections that are slated to happen later this year and the Lok Sabha election due next year.

“This being an election year, government will go in election mode and governance will likely take some hit. We have three to four big state elections this year. So there is nervousness in the markets at this point of time,” said Haldea of Prime Database.",Market volatility seen affecting IPO plans of smaller companies,"['smaller', 'ipos', 'index', 'plans', 'small', 'valuations', 'midcap', 'seen', 'ipo', 'stocks', 'companies', 'volatility', 'affecting', 'markets', 'bse', 'market']","In the year to date, the BSE Midcap Index has lost 10.73% and the BSE Smallcap Index 11.27%, underperforming the 3.08% loss in the benchmark Sensex.

Mumbai: Capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will consider closely supervising the work of auditors, independent valuers and compliance secretaries and penalize them for lapses at its board meeting on 28 March, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The Sebi board will also consider proposals such as making algorithmic trading cheaper and more accessible, and reducing fees charged by mutual funds to unit holders.

Norms for companies admitted to bankruptcy court related to their trading, delisting, and disclosures will also be discussed, the people said, requesting anonymity.

The proposal to increase auditor oversight comes amid a move by the government to set up the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) as an independent regulator for auditors, who are facing greater scrutiny after a $2-billion fraud was discovered at a Mumbai branch of state-run Punjab National Bank last month.

“Under the proposed norms, Sebi will have powers to disgorge ill-gotten gains and bar auditors from the securities market,” said one of the people cited earlier.

This is in line with the recommendations of a panel on corporate governance under banker Uday Kotak, which had suggested that the markets regulator examine the role of third-party fiduciaries.

However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in India (ICAI) had protested the move as it was already regulating auditors.

“Action against expert advisers has been rare. The reason is CAs (chartered accountants) and valuers always claim to use information provided by management. They lend their name to dubious financial statements and valuations,” said R. Narayanaswamy, professor of finance and control at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore.

“In my role as audit committee chair, I have found that a standard ploy is to describe the valuation report or opinion as “draft for internal discussion only” and include a whole lot of disclaimers that make it impossible to pin down responsibility on the expert. Sebi should ban the use of such reports by management and board. Listed companies should be required to engage CAs, valuers and other experts who meet stringent standards of competence, ethics and track record,” Narayanaswamy said.

In addition, Sebi will also issue a discussion paper on removing hurdles that are being faced by listed insolvent firms during their resolution proceedings. “Sebi will issue a discussion paper that whether trading in such shares should be suspended or not to prevent undue volatility in shares,” said the second of the three people cited earlier.

The discussion paper will also address issues such as easing the delisting process for insolvent companies, fixing of the delisting price, relaxing the requirement that every listed firm should have a minimum public ownership of 25% and so on.

Besides, Sebi will also reduce the expenses charged by mutual funds by 10-15 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

This is based on its internal study that mutual fund schemes have levied some charges to the investors unethically, said the second of the three people cited earlier.

In 2012, Sebi had allowed mutual funds to charge 20 basis points of assets under management of the scheme in lieu of exit loads, or the sum collected from investors when they sell holdings.

The regulator told the fund houses to add back exit loads to the schemes to prevent loss to other investors.

“But since then Sebi has observed that hardly any benefit has come to an investor,” this person said.

Another key reform agenda is to make algorithmic trading cheaper, make it more accessible and reduce preferential access by allowing brokers to share co-location facilities. Co-location allows members to place their servers in the exchange premises for faster access to trading and feeds. In addition, Sebi is also proposing that tick-by-tick data feed be given free of charge. Tick-by-tick is a data-heavy feed that provides details of all orders and trades on a real-time basis.

NSE and BSE didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the impact of the proposed move on revenues. For the year to March 2017, NSE generated Rs400 crore from co-location services, about 15% of its overall revenue .

New York: US stocks tumbled the most in six weeks and Treasuries rallied as investors shifted focus from the US Federal Reserve to the threat of an escalating trade war with China that has the potential to disrupt global growth.

The benchmark S&P 500 Index slumped the most since early February and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 500 points after President Donald Trump announced $50 billion in China tariffs on imports from that country. The 10-year treasury yield slid toward 2.8 and gold advanced with the yen as investors sought safe havens. The dollar rebounded.

“This morning markets were likely to be down because Facebook and other tech companies having difficulty and the tariff announcement just basically held buyers back, nobody wanted to step in front of the announcement just in case,” said Jamie Cox, a managing partner for Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.

The threat that a tit-for-tat trade spat with China will erupt and hamper global growth has investors on edge a day after the Fed sought to reassure markets that it’s in no hurry to raise rates even as it lifted growth projections for the world’s largest economy. Trump’s first trade action directly aimed at China would come as policymakers including IMF managing director Christine Lagarde warn of a global trade conflict that could undermine the broadest world recovery in years.

US stocks were also hit when John Dowd resigned as Trump’s lead attorney countering Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe as the inquiry into possible collusion in the 2016 election intensifies.

Facebook Inc. helped pace a decline in the tech sector, falling as much as 2.5% before paring losses. This week’s selloff in tech stocks is on pace to be the worst since early February. Other notable decliners Thursday included Accenture Plc and Micron Technology Inc., which reports fiscal second-quarter earnings after the close of trading.

Elsewhere, West Texas oil fluctuated before falling and the Australian dollar slipped after the country’s unemployment rate climbed. The British pound initially jumped after the country’s central bank voted 7-2 to maintain interest rates, but pared as investors digested comments from policy makers that weren’t overtly hawkish.

Mumbai: The benchmark BSE Sensex fell by 130 points on Thursday due to profit booking in realty, capital goods, tech, auto and banking stocks due to renewed global trade war fears and losses in European markets.

The 30-share Sensex opened higher at 33,206.99 and advanced to hit a high of 33,281.77 in early trade. However, it slipped into the negative zone to touch a low of 32,963.31 in afternoon trade as fresh worries appeared after reports that the US President Donald Trump is mulling new sanctions on China.

The benchmark finally ended lower by 129.91 points or 0.39% at 33,006.27, ending its two-day gaining streak. The NSE Nifty closed down by 40.50 points or 0.39% at 10,114.75 as banking stocks dropped. It shuttled between 10,207.85 and 10,105.40 during the day.

“Market started on a positive note on account of less hawkish Fed commentary on CY18 rate hike trajectory and in turn US 10-year yield declined. However, the gains were only short lived due to negative trend in European and other Asian market owing to re-emergence of trade war,” Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said. “Investors are utilising every rally as an opportunity to sell,” he added.

The US Trade Representative (USTR) said America has strong evidence of Beijing violating its commitments on intellectual property and technology transfers, fanning speculation that the White House may announce sanctions against China on Friday. China also promised to reply with “necessary measures” to defend its “legitimate rights and interests”.

Equity benchmarks erased early gains after realty, capital goods, tech, auto, PSU, IT, power and bankex counters came under selling pressure, falling up to 1.28%. Banking stocks again faced the heat largely due to weekly derivatives expiry in the NSE Bank Nifty. SBI, ICICI Bank, PNB, Canara Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, and Bank of Baroda ended with losses up to 2.62%.

Other losers included Wipro, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Dr Reddy’s, Adani Ports, Infosys, Bajaj Auto, L&T, TCS, Coal India, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, ITC, Tata Steel and HUL, falling up to 2.32%. However, ONGC, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, RIL, Sun Pharma, Asian Paint and NTPC ended in the positive zone, rising up to 2.45%.

Selling pressure also emerged in the broader markets the BSE small-cap index down by 1.05% and mid-caps fell 0.75%. Among the BSE sectoral indices, realty fell the most at 1.28%, followed by capital goods (1.07%), tech (0.99%), auto (0.94%), PSU (0.93%), IT (0.91%), infrastructure (0.69%), power (0.66%), bankex (0.66%), healthcare (0.60%), FMCG (0.36%) and oil & gas (0.29%). However, consumer durables rose by 0.79% and metal 0.37%.

Globally, Asian share markets ended mixed and European bourses opened lower following overnight losses on Wall Street after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year. The Federal Reserve delivered its sixth interest-rate increase since the end of 2015 and signalled it still expects to deliver two more before the end of the year.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.09%, Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.53% and Singapore down 0.65%, while Japan’s Nikkei was up by 0.99%. In the Eurozone, Paris CAC 40 fell 1.06% and Frankfurt moved down 1.01% in their early deals. The UK’s FTSE also traded lower 0.53%.","Sensex, Nifty drop as trade war fears grip markets","['auto', 'tech', 'goods', 'drop', 'ended', 'points', 'fears', 'sensex', 'nifty', 'grip', 'realty', 'stocks', 'markets', 'trade', 'fell', 'war', 'bank']","The benchmark BSE Sensex fell by 130 points on Thursday due to profit booking in realty, capital goods, tech, auto and banking stocks.

Mumbai: Northern Arc Capital, earlier known as IFMR Capital, is looking to raise funds through a private round, ahead of its plans to go public, said two people aware of the development.

“The financial services company is planning to raise fresh capital from private markets ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO). They are expected to soon start a formal process for the same. They could raise around a couple of a hundred crores at least in this round,” said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.

IFMR Capital rebranded itself as Northern Arc Capital in February this year. Established in 2008, the company connects non-banking financial companies working among financially excluded households and businesses with investors in existing and emerging debt capital markets. The company also has an asset management business, which invests in debt instruments of these companies, and has assets worth Rs850 crore.

Mint reported in January that the company was in talks to appoint investment banks for an IPO. Emails sent to Northern Arc Capital did not elicit any response.

Several IPO-bound companies have raised funds through pre-IPO financing in recent months. In November, Mint reported that funds worth almost $600 million was raised by IPO-bound companies in 2017. The activity was led by large deals such as the $383 million funding round by a consortium of investors led by Warburg Pincus in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd and IIFL Special Opportunities Fund’s $60 million bet on Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd.

Several public markets-focused institutional investors such as hedge funds, family offices and high net-worth individuals, too, have tapped pre-IPO financing opportunities.

In September, Mint reported that Prataap Snacks Ltd had raised Rs50 crore in a pre-IPO round from public market investor Malabar Investments. The following month, Mint reported that private equity firms Aditya Birla Private Equity and Multiples Alternate Asset Management had sold part of their stakes in IPO-bound Indian Energy Exchange Ltd to several high net-worth individuals and SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd.

Northern Arc Capital is backed by PE firms Eight Roads Capital and Standard Chartered Private Equity (SCPE).

In December 2016, SCPE announced an investment of $17 million in Northern Arc Capital, with a commitment to increase it further to a total of $50 million.

New Delhi: The income tax (I-T) website still bars taxpayers from filing their returns without an Aadhaar number, in spite of a Supreme Court order that indefinitely extended the deadline for mandatory linking of the unique identity number.

With only 10 days left for filing I-T returns for the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17, individual taxpayers who haven’t filed their returns for the two years and have not enrolled for Aadhaar are unsure whether they can file their returns at all.

Income tax rules still maintain that I-T returns cannot be e-filed without quoting an Aadhaar number, despite the 13 March order directing the government to not make it mandatory to quote Aadhaar until the Supreme Court announces its final verdict.

The “income tax utility on its e-filing website does not allow you to file a return without quoting the Aadhaar or enrolment number”, said Amit Maheshwari, a partner at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates Llp.

The Finance Act 2017 made it mandatory to quote Aadhaar while e-filing with effect from 1 July 2017. For this, the taxpayer needs to link Aadhaar with his/her Permanent Account Number.

Sushil Chandra, chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) did not respond to phone calls or messages sent by Mint till press time. However, a CBDT spokesperson said, “We are seized of this issue and are looking into it”.

“While the (court) ruling does not specifically mention exclusion of the requirement to link Aadhaar for tax purposes, in the absence of any further notification from the CBDT, it may be assumed that linking Aadhaar for tax purposes may still be needed. However, there is no clarity in the matter and a clarification from the CBDT on this would be helpful,” said Divya Baweja, partner, Deloitte India.

Mandatorily asking for the Aadhaar number flouts the Supreme Court order. “Ideally, they (the I-T department) should have rectified the system, allowing income-tax assessees to file returns without quoting Aadhaar or enrolment number, as directed by the Supreme Court,” said Abhishek A. Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co. “I expect that department will adhere to the Supreme Court order and make the changes.”

If it fails to do so, “any person can approach the high court, which will take cognition of the fact and ask the department to implement the order”, said Rastogi.

However, the rule to quote Aadhaar to file I-T returns only applies to resident Indians, or people who live in India for 182 days or more in the 12 months immediately before the date of application for Aadhaar enrolment. Non-residents who file taxes in India, individual assessees living in Assam, Jammu and Kashmir and Meghalaya and very senior citizens (who were 80 years or older at any time during the previous year) are exempt from mandatorily quoting Aadhaar in their I-T returns.",You still can’t file I-T returns without Aadhaar number,"['tax', 'file', 'quoting', 'cbdt', 'cant', 'supreme', 'order', 'number', 'aadhaar', 'returns', 'court']","Supreme Court has indefinitely extended indefinitely the Aadhaar linking deadline for mobile numbers and bank accounts, but doesn’t specifically mention I-T returns.

Gold prices held steady on Thursday, hovering near two-week highs hit in the previous session on a weaker dollar after the US Federal Reserve disappointed investors, who were expecting more hawkish comments on interest rate rises.

The Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast at least two more hikes in 2018, contrary to three more increases most market watchers expected. In its first policy meeting under new Fed chief Jerome Powell, the US central bank indicated that inflation should finally move higher after years below its 2% target and that the economy had recently gained momentum.

“The FOMC statement was more dovish than we thought warranted ... At some stage, the Fed will have to grasp the nettle, but the danger is that in doing so, it will bring forward a credit crunch,” said Alasdair Macleod, head of research with Toronto-based Goldmoney Inc. “These are good conditions for gold, because we can expect the dollar to weaken.”

Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,332.77 per ounce at 1.09pm. Prices rose to a two-week high of $1,336.59 of Wednesday, and also registered their biggest single-day percentage gain since 17 May 2017. US gold futures for April delivery rose 0.7% to $1,331.10 per ounce.

“The fact that gold approached its recent 2018 low (of $1,306.91) on Tuesday, but failed to penetrate it, must also be construed as a constructive sign for technical traders,” INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was down 0.3% at 89.509, after touching an over one-month low of 89.396. The Fed’s decision led the U.S. dollar to its largest fall in two months.

Meanwhile, investors see trade tensions between the US and China lending further support to gold, which is seen as a safe-heaven asset during times of political and financial uncertainty.

“If you factor in the significant near-term geopolitical concerns and the uncertain equity market fallout from an escalation of a trade war with China, gold has to be a mainstay component in any investment portfolio,” Stephen Innes, APAC trading head at OANDA, said.

In other precious metals, spot silver was up 0.3% to $16.57 per ounce, while platinum gained 0.6% to $959.30 per ounce. Palladium was little changed at $989.72 per ounce.

Mumbai: India’s record foreign exchange reserves somewhat mask the country’s vulnerability on its external finances. That’s the takeaway from a note by UBS Group AG’s India economist Tanvee Gupta Jain.

Foreign exchange reserves at $421 billion cover 81% of external debt as of September 2017 and less than 11 months of imports. That’s down from 138% of debt before the global financial crisis and 14.4 months of imports in the 2008 fiscal year, respectively, according to the UBS note.

“India remains vulnerable in its external position and risks are rising on the margin,” Jain wrote in the note. “There is no room for complacency and we think policy makers should keep a close watch on monitoring this risk.”

The rupee is already among the worst performing currencies in Asia this year as foreigners pull money out of bonds and inflows into stocks slow. The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates on Wednesday and forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 is putting pressure on emerging-market currencies, like the rupee.

The trade deficit has also ballooned from a year ago and caused the current account deficit to nearly double, while firmer prices for oil—India’s biggest import item—are only set to cloud the outlook.

While gross external debt rose by $86 billion between March 2013 and September 2017, foreign exchange reserves rose $108 billion during the same period. That’s a sign the Reserve Bank of India has been intervening in the currency market to put buffers in place in case the global financial market volatility hits home.

Jain said that when the Federal Reserve indicated tapering in mid-2013, India had the highest outflow from the debt market, to the tune of $8.6 billion, even though equity flow remained positive.

“This time, we believe India is in a relatively better position compared with other emerging markets, since fundamentals are stronger now,” she said.

Mumbai: Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd (HCC) shares slumped over 15% on Thursday, its biggest fall in 16 month, after a report that its arm Lavasa Corp. Ltd may turn bankrupt.

HCC shares fell 14.87%, its steepest fall since November 2016, and touched a low of Rs24.60 a share. At 11.15am, the stock was trading at Rs25.60 on BSE, down 11.3% from its previous close. So far this year it declined 38% while BSE Realty Index fell 11%.

“The Lavasa management is planning to declare bankruptcy and is likely to approach the NCLT by the end of this month i.e, March 2018. The funds-starved company is finding it difficult to manage day-to-day operations and has started resorting to selling non-core equipment to raise money and meet immediate expenses,” reported DNA.

“Besides, the pressure is also building from people who had bought apartments/villas many years ago to refund the money as they have not been given a possession of their respective assets,” the report added.

As of September 2017, total standalone debt of HCC stood at Rs3,672 crore.

Real estate sector is under pressure from last few years as developers unable to sell their inventories due to weak demand conditions.

A January report by Knight Frank India showed that home sales volume hit a seven-year low in 2017, seeing a 38% decline from the peak of 2011. Home launches, too, saw a sharp fall of 78% last year to 103,570 housing units from 480,424 in 2010.

In February, India Rating has maintained its negative rating on the sector and expects muted sales and margins to remain under pressure owing to a rise in input costs and an increase in selling and promotion costs amid weak demand conditions.

“This would lead to an increase in the inventory and debt levels of real estate firms in FY19. Refinancing risk remains at an elevated level owing to weak credit profiles. The quality of inventory would be the key differentiating factor for companies in this sector to determine their relative refinancing capability,” according to the India Rating report.",HCC shares slump 15% on report of possible Lavasa bankruptcy,"['bse', 'fall', 'rating', 'pressure', 'india', 'weak', 'hcc', 'bankruptcy', 'shares', 'report', 'slump', 'lavasa', 'possible', 'fell', '15', 'sector']","At 11.15am, the HCC stock was trading at Rs25.60 on BSE, down 11.3% from its previous close.

Mumbai: Lack of surprises in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting outcome did not drag Indian stock markets on Thursday despite an interest rate hike by the US central bank.

The US Federal Reserve officials, meeting for the first time under chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point. Policy makers continued to project a total of three interest rate hikes this year.

In the forecasts, Fed officials projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019, implying three rate hikes next year, compared with two moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December.

Higher interest rates in the US generally lead to outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets considered to be riskier assets.

Analysts said that more than the interest rates hike in the US, trade war treats lurking over global markets may have a deeper impact on the way foreign investors allocate funds into emerging markets including India.

According to a Bloomberg report, US President Donald Trump is set to announce about $50 billion of tariffs against China over intellectual-property violations. It will be Trump’s first trade action directly aimed at China, which he has blamed for the hollowing out of the American manufacturing sector and the loss of US jobs.

Pankaj Pandey, research head at ICICI Securities, said that the bigger worry would be trade war which may derail or curtail the over-all global growth. “That would be a bigger challenge for global investors which will impact most of the markets including India. Otherwise, I don’t think Fed rates hike will hurt FII flows to India,” he said.

VK Sharma, head PCG and Capital Market Strategy at HDFC Securities, said that the near term implications of the Fed policy are less hawkish than what the markets had pencilled in. “History has shown that unless the real interest rates rise beyond 2.5% the markets can very well take these hikes into stride. So we are not worried by the three hikes in 2019,” Sharma added.

According to Pandey, the markets are likely to stay in a range now. “Treasury income for banks will take a knock while asset resolution may take some more time. As a result, banking firms which contributes 40% to the index will hit overall earnings growth. Corporate earnings will appear flattish which would mean the markets will remain range bound. Combined to it, political anxiety will keep markets in tight range,” he added.

Photo: Reuters

Mumbai: Anil Agarwal-promoted Vedanta Ltd has finalized the terms of a Rs4,000 crore bond issue at a time rising yields have depressed local debt issuances, two people aware of the development said.

The company, with business interests ranging across zinc, lead, silver, oil & gas, aluminium, copper, iron ore and power, plans to sell bonds maturing in three years at a likely coupon rate of 8.50%, the people mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.

The money raised from the Vedanta bond issue will be used for working capital requirements, general corporate purposes and to refinance debt.

In a notice to stock exchanges on Tuesday, Vedanta informed that it proposes to raise up to Rs4,500 crore in one or more tranches though secured non-convertible debentures. The company’s committee of directors will be meeting in this regard on 23 March.

“Vedanta is a marque name and bonds from the manufacturing sector usually have higher demand as they are not sold very frequently. This has helped the company to get commitments of investors, from mutual funds to insurance companies, and price the bonds at a finer rate despite a large size of the issue, especially at a time when yields have hardened,” said the first person mentioned above.

According to bond dealers, amid rising bond yields, not all companies can price bonds at a cheaper rate. Corporate bonds are priced at a premium over government bond yields, which have risen because of fiscal concerns and expectation of rising interest rates.

Rating agency Crisil has assigned AA as Vedanta’s long-term rating. On 12 March, Crisil upgraded its outlook on the long-term bank facilities and debt programmes of Vedanta to 'positive' from 'stable'.

“The revision in outlook reflects Crisil's expectation of a strengthening business profile driven by a structural improvement in aluminium profitability and expected volume ramp-up across businesses, both of which should support a greater resilience of Vedanta's profitability to a decline in commodity prices. The revision in outlook also reflects expectation of continued deleveraging over the medium term,” Crisil said in a note.

What is special about Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Ltd launching a new fixed maturity plan (FMP)? On 20 March, it launched a new fund called Franklin India Fixed Maturity Plan Series 3 Plan D (1,132 Days). The mutual funds industry has launched 253 FMPs, in this financial year (2017-18), so far, as per Value Research data.

But Franklin Templeton’s FMP launch is different. Its last FMP was in March 2007. After launching a single FMP in 2016-17, it has launched nine so far in this financial year. What explains this sudden love?

While retail investors largely invest in equity funds, a fund house’s institutional clients - like companies—prefer to invest in debt funds to park their short-term surpluses to earn superior returns. But because their investment’s time horizon, these companies prefer safety over high returns. And here’s where, distributors tell us, companies didn’t invest in Franklin Templeton’s debt funds as much as they did in other fund houses.

In the past many years, Franklin Templeton India’s debt funds largely preferred to invest in corporate bonds of companies that, it feels, are well-managed, but suffer from a weak credit rating. Although Santosh Kamath, managing director - fixed income, Franklin Templeton Investments, India, has government securities funds under his fixed income funds’ division, for the past many years, much of Templeton’s debt funds have focused on identifying weak credit rated companies but where the fund houses sees potential; an area where Kamath and his team earned many bouquets and some brickbats over the years.

Among the top 15 fund houses in terms of fixed income assets, 78.9% of Franklin Templeton’s fixed income assets lie in securities rated AA & lower; the most in such companies. L&T Investment Management Ltd comes closest, with just 38.3% of its fixed income assets in these companies. Just 21.1% of Franklin Templeton’s fixed income assets lie in G-Secs; the least allocation to G-Secs by the top 15 fund houses in terms of their debt funds’ assets.

“Franklin Templeton has not been getting institutional money. Large companies have enough funds to invest from other fund houses such as HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and so on. Corporates do not like to invest in bond funds that take credit risk. They want safety”, says a large distributor who did not wish to be quoted.

The mutual funds industry launched 288 FMPs in financial year (FY) 2015-16, 216 FMPs in FY2016-17 and 253 FMPs in FY2017-18 so far.

While the fund house is said to be popular among retail investors, it’s handling of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) after two downgrades of JSPL debt papers, as well as the many debt schemes of the fund house containing low credit-rated instruments is said to have spooked many institutional clients.

To be fair, Franklin Templeton’s debt schemes comes with a good track record, but institutional customers typically prefer higher rated assets. That is also why Franklin Templeton’s FMPs aims to invest the corpus in high-rated (AAA-rated) assets.

“While we have a strong product line-up in the managed credit space, we do have a few gaps in the high credit space including closed ended funds like FMPs. We seek client feedback and review our fund range periodically; one of the requirements our customers highlighted was for high credit FMPs. Their introduction has not only helped to make our product suite more holistic but also helped us diversify our investor mix”, said Sanjay Sapre, president.

Mumbai: Cautious foreign investors, who have been selling government bonds, could potentially impact the sovereign borrowing, set to resume from April, and keep bond yields elevated.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned net sellers of Indian debt as worries that widening current account deficit, higher fiscal deficit target and prospects of further rate hikes in the US may led to monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India.

On late Wednesday, US Federal Reserve officials, for the first time under chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points and forecast a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing an improving economic outlook. That is likely to add to outflows of foreign investment.

In addition, $2 billion fraud in the state run Punjab National Bank has also soured investor sentiments.

Analysts believe that current account deficit (CAD) will widen further, which may impact capital flows and put further pressure on rupee and bond prices.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have sold nearly $2.33 billion in debt over the last one month and have been sellers for all but six trading sessions during the period. So far this year as well, FIIs have remained net sellers and have sold $222.66 million in debt.

The selling escalated last week after RBI data showed that CAD for December quarter widened to 2% of the gross domestic product, or $13.5 billion, up from 1.4%, or $8 billion, in the corresponding period a year ago.

Since the budget announcement on 29 January, rupee has weakened nearly 2.48%. So far this year, the rupee has depreciated 2.05%. The 10-year bond yield has risen by 14 basis points since budget and from August 2017, it jumped nearly 111 basis points.

“The outlook for India government bonds remains challenging but some value may be emerging after the sharp sell-off over the past six months. In addition to renewed supply pressure into FY19 domestically, developed market yields are likely to rise further as monetary normalisation continues. Under these circumstances, bond yields are still likely to face upward pressure”, said Radhika Rao economist at DBS Bank.

According to bond dealers, a hike in limit for FPIs to purchase government securities may create demand for bonds at a time when most public sector banks have stayed away from investing. This was also one of the suggestion made by bond dealers, who met finance ministry officials on Wednesday.

The current framework for FPI investment expires this month.

Currently, FPIs have exhausted 97.39% of the available limit for investing in Indian government bonds. This is essentially for FPIs under open category, which is most active.

“I don’t think view is that avoid India. People have gone cautious. But in case the hike in limit comes through, it will be taken positively. You may not see FPIs rushing to buy at one go but spreading it over a period because even on fully hedged basis, over 3% plus returns,” said a senior official of a foreign bank, requesting anonymity.

Global trade war and the increased prospects of more rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve have also added to nervousness in the markets.

“Hardening commodity prices, rising trade restrictions and expected revival in domestic consumption are likely to elevate the CAD further in FY19 to 2.5%. Going forward, the rising tide of global trade restrictions could also encompass capital flow restrictions,which along with synchronous global normalization of monetary policies could impact overall capital flows,” said Emkay Research in a note to its investors.",Foreign investors sell $2.33 billion of debt in February,"['investors', 'bonds', 'likely', 'foreign', 'billion', 'fpis', 'debt', '233', 'rate', 'bond', 'impact', 'sell', 'basis']","Cautious foreign investors, who have been selling government bonds, could potentially impact the sovereign borrowing, set to resume from April.

Singapore: Interested in emerging-market debt but wary about rising bond yields as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates? Then it might be worth looking at what used to be a riskier option— local-currency bonds.

Historically low inflation rates in countries from Indonesia to Brazil mean, as a group, developing nations aren’t facing the pressure they sometimes had during US monetary tightening cycles. And with the US dollar depreciating even as the Fed hikes, local-currency debt has some insulation from worries such as supply hitting the Treasuries market.

“In a period of a weak dollar, EM local bonds will benefit from the improvement in the currency component,” said Manu George, Singapore-based senior investment director of Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management. “Returns from EM local bonds could outperform EM dollar bonds.”

Domestic notes sold by developing-nation governments have returned 1.9% so far this year, extending last year’s gain of more than 14%. Dollar securities from emerging markets, including corporate debt, are down 1.9% this year, according to a Bloomberg Barclays indexes.

The local debt could even be something of a refuge if trade tensions escalate, in the view of some. President Donald Trump’s protectionist moves have served in part to highlight the US trade deficit and the increasing borrowing needs of the world’s No. 1 economy, with the fiscal gap widening.

Without doubt

“I would take advantage of any weakness that generates to add to emerging-market FX risk,” said Edwin Gutierrez, London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments, referring to concerns of a potential trade war. He said he prefers “local currency without a doubt because of the weak dollar.”

His favourites are Brazilian, Indian and Russian local-currency debt, as their rates remain high relative to inflation.

The hard-currency notes from developing nations are likely to underperform because they remain “very correlated” to Treasuries, said Jean-Charles Sambor, the London-based head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

Fed officials, in the first interest rate decision under chairman Jerome Powell, raised the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point on Wednesday and forecast a steeper path of hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing an improving economic outlook. The US Treasury’s yield curve from 2 to 10 years steepened Wednesday.

While the potential for “massive” reductions in premiums on local-currency debt is now gone, after the big run-up in the securities, BNP Paribas’s Sambor said there are “still pretty compelling stories” in markets including India, Indonesia, Brazil and Peru.

Meantime, don’t count dollar bonds out completely. George at Schroder said “a rise in yields will make good quality EM dollar bonds attractive and we are likely to add exposure if yields show signs of stabilization.” He prefers corporate bonds for the yield pick-up, with examples including Petroleos Mexicanos and Petroleo Brasileiro SA.

255,The growth rate of contract workers has been far higher than that of directly employed workers,https://www.livemint.com/Money/in820rBafIqhkbesEyBJoI/The-growth-rate-of-contract-workers-has-been-far-higher-than.html,"Between 1997-98 and 2014-15, CAGR of directly employed workers was a piffling 0.55%. In stark contrast, CAGR of contract workers over the same period was 6.79%","The Narendra Modi government’s amendment of the labour rules to employ more workers on contract may give more flexibility to companies, but the process of substituting contract workers for regular employees has been going on for years. As the accompanying Chart 1 shows, contract workers now make up more than a third of all workers employed in the formal manufacturing sector.

Data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) on employment in organized manufacturing shows that contract labour has become increasingly important. In 1997-98, the ASI data shows that directly employed workers were five times the number of those employed through contractors. By 2014-15, the latest year for which data is available, regular workers in manufacturing were only 1.8 times those employed through contractors.

Looked at another way, in the 17 years between 1997-98 and 2014-15, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of directly employed workers was a piffling 0.55%. In stark contrast, the CAGR of contract workers over the same period was 6.79%.

In fact, the number of regular employees in organized manufacturing fell sharply between 1997-98 and 2003-04, as Indian industry shed excess manpower and employed the latest technology, which was mostly labour-saving, in order to become competitive. Indeed, the CAGR in direct employment in the 10 years between 2004-05 and 2014-15 is a more respectable 3.67%. But that growth pales in comparison to the 8.08% CAGR in contract labour in these years.

In the manufacture of motor vehicles, for example, workers employed as contract labour are now 45.9% of total workers employed. In 1997-98, contract labour was 10.9% of total workers directly employed.

In the manufacture of beverages, tobacco products, coke and refined petroleum products, “other non-metallic mineral products” and in “repair and installation of machinery and equipment”, contract labour is more than the number of directly employed workers. Even in capital-intensive sectors such as the manufacture of basic metals, contract labour was 46.5% of total workers employed. Chart 2 has the details.

The new rules assure pay parity for contract workers. However, a study by A.K. Panigrahi of the Central Statistics Office said that, in 2012-13, “it is clearly observed that contract workers are getting 60% less wage than that of the direct workers”.

The study also said that most industrialized states had a higher proportion of contract workers in organized manufacturing.",The growth rate of contract workers has been far higher than that of directly employed workers,"['contract', '199798', 'labour', 'employed', 'manufacturing', 'directly', 'higher', 'cagr', 'shows', 'total', 'rate', 'far', 'workers', 'growth']","As the accompanying Chart 1 shows, contract workers now make up more than a third of all workers employed in the formal manufacturing sector.
